2013-06-17 15:04:47	jonathanwallace	for weechat?
2013-06-17 15:05:05	greggroth	yeah.  I had to disable all of my plugins because one was causing a crash on load.
2013-06-17 15:05:39	greggroth	I haven't taken the time to figure out which one was causing problems, but wanted to get your input on what's good for desktop notifications
2013-06-17 15:05:50	greggroth	People ping me in IRC and I don't notice
2013-06-17 15:06:00	jonathanwallace	notify_tags_ison = "notify_message"
2013-06-17 15:06:02	jonathanwallace	notify_tags_whois = "notify_message"
2013-06-17 15:06:16	jonathanwallace	intersect.notify
2013-06-17 15:06:24	jonathanwallace	i think that's all i had to do for notifications
2013-06-17 15:06:29	jonathanwallace	no extra setup
