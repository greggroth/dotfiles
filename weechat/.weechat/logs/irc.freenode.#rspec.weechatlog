2013-01-31 08:47:56	Spaceghost|work	Morning.
2013-01-31 08:49:47	shep-werk	Spaceghost|work: you're welcome. Hope it helps :-)
2013-01-31 08:50:19	shep-werk	freedrull: Have you read the RSpec book? I find it has a good description for when to pop down / up
2013-01-31 08:50:25	Spaceghost|work	shep-werk: It did! I had done it like this before: http://pastie.org/5972104
2013-01-31 08:50:29	Spaceghost|work	I like yours a lot more.
2013-01-31 08:51:14	shep-werk	Spaceghost|work: :-) It's easier to turn on/off and a bit isolated, so I like those aspects
2013-01-31 08:51:35	shep-werk	it's still a little odd - a single symbol somewhere does ~~magic~~ to your tests
2013-01-31 08:51:58	shep-werk	but if you know what's happening...
2013-01-31 08:52:01	<--	stepheneb (~stepheneb@otrunk/stepheneb) has quit (Quit: stepheneb)
2013-01-31 08:52:25	shep-werk	freedrull: but generally, you just write the test you wish you had, then write the code you wish you had
2013-01-31 08:52:49	shep-werk	once you write the code you wish you had, you are probably calling methods/objects that don't exist yet
2013-01-31 08:53:20	shep-werk	so then you push another level deeper and write the tests for that (based on the higher level needs) and write the code you wish you had
2013-01-31 08:53:40	shep-werk	and then you call methods / objects that don't exist yet... rinse and repeat

2013-01-31 08:54:09	shep-werk	you pop back up once you write the code you wish you had and all the tests pass :-)
2013-01-31 08:54:20	shep-werk	(where "all" == for that object)
2013-01-31 08:55:21	Spaceghost|work	shep-werk: I have a lot of fun when the number of concentric feedback loops I open in a new feature becomes > 4, because as soon as I close the deepest loop, the others close around it.
2013-01-31 08:55:23	Spaceghost|work	It's really fun.
2013-01-31 08:56:22	shep-werk	Spaceghost|work: I'm always suspicious when multiple levels go green at the same time
2013-01-31 08:56:37	shep-werk	"What test(s) did I forget to write?" :-)
2013-01-31 08:57:11	Spaceghost|work	shep-werk: When they're concentric, the completion of the deepest unit test should pass the integration test between itself and its collaborators and resonate outwards, no?
2013-01-31 08:58:41	Spaceghost|work	On vertical feature slices at least.
2013-01-31 08:58:45	shep-werk	Spaceghost|work: only if you never need to have 2 or more tests wide
2013-01-31 08:59:18	shep-werk	So yeah, it's most ideal if you can slice thin enough that it's one test wide

2013-01-31 08:59:50	Spaceghost|work	shep-werk: When doing railsy stuff, I tend to have to go functional -> routing -> controller -> optional services -> models -> optional services
2013-01-31 09:00:21	Spaceghost|work	You can't pass the functional test without real working code, so your units can pass on the way down, but the integration tests fail until the deepest part is completed.
2013-01-31 09:00:43	shep-werk	Spaceghost|work: do you actually write routing specs? I thought people like you were mythical :-)
2013-01-31 09:01:07	Spaceghost|work	shep-werk: I cheat though. include Rails.application.routes.url_helpers is your friend.
2013-01-31 09:01:59	Spaceghost|work	Also, I don't always do straightforward routes. I've had to route a request through the app and have it intercepted by a rack app mounted in the system.
2013-01-31 09:02:08	Spaceghost|work	For that kind of complexity, you'll want a routing spec.

2013-01-31 13:13:11	hashpuppy	let's say that i have some complicated search method on Model1.  I have a spec for that.  Now I have a controller that calls that and outputs that as json (with only a few fields).  What should that controller test look like?  Do I need to test that it's filtering correctly?  Because I already do that in the model spec?  Or do I just make sure it returns json w/ the expected keys?

2013-02-01 15:23:27	totallymike	Hi there.  I'm having trouble with rails fixtures in rspec.  Specifically, that they don't load predictably.
2013-02-01 15:24:00	totallymike	see this gist: http://apidock.com/rails/Module/alias_method_chain

2013-02-01 15:24:58	totallymike	It uses the random method to decide which tests get run first.  When the "user loading" examples run first, they pass, but the "role authorization" example doesn't.  When the order is reversed, neither pass.

2013-02-01 15:29:04	totallymike	What seems to happen is that ActiveRecord can't find the user in whatever second spec has urn.

2013-02-01 15:29:32	totallymike	I know this is the rspec channel and not the RAILS channel, but nobody there has much of an idea, so I thought I'd move over here and ask.
