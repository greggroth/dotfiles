2013-12-04 11:54:31	Nevik	i was wondering why it is placed in contrib
2013-12-04 11:54:41	CorySimmons	So I'm an idiot and added a bunch of changes to ONE commit. How can I do several splits to this one commit?

2013-12-04 13:08:24	ch1n0o	I mean that when doing a push then I have nothing to make another commit

2013-12-04 13:09:10	qkzoo1978	so I made a commit push from one remote to the master, then on another I did git diff master, but it didnt display anything.
2013-12-04 13:10:07	imachuchu	ch1n0o: push is for copying things to a remote. If you have 2 divergent branches locally then you can cherry-pick commits to create new ones on a different branch (if they are the same branch then you can just merge to get an ff-merge)
2013-12-04 13:10:10	grawity	qkzoo1978: did you fetch?

2013-12-04 13:15:50	imachuchu	qkzoo1978: fetch and pull are confusing, blame svn and other VCS (git was written to try and be easy to use with knowledge of them, and so it can get a bit messy)
2013-12-04 13:16:27	qkzoo1978	makes sense, still learning though :)
2013-12-04 13:16:27	Curly-Brace	hello all
2013-12-04 13:16:28	@gitinfo	Curly-Brace: hi! I'd like to automatically welcome you to #git, a place full of helpful gits. Got a question? Just ask it — chances are someone will answer fairly soon. The topic has links with more information about git and this channel. NB. it can't hurt to do a backup (type !backup for help) before trying things out, especially if they involve dangerous keywords such as --hard, clean, --force/-f, rm and so on.
2013-12-04 13:16:53	qkzoo1978	thanks for your clarifications :)
2013-12-04 13:17:27	Curly-Brace	I checked out 'Bob's' repository, and made a local change.  Now, I want to commit that change to MY fork of the project - how do I do this?
2013-12-04 13:18:10	_ikke_	Curly-Brace: You add your fork as a remote, and then push to that
2013-12-04 13:18:17	Curly-Brace	ah

2013-12-04 13:22:59	+bamj0rb	So git pull is sort of like svn update, if you ignore the fact that Git is distributed and represents history with a DAG.

2013-12-04 13:23:14	masak	SVN's commit is a bit like Git's commit+push -- and they're inseparable in SVN.

2013-12-05 01:41:08	cbreak-work	it's the reason I see why it doesn't work. Doesn't mean it can't be changed to support merging of trees
2013-12-05 01:41:43	leehambley	probably this is a misuse of git-archive, and of course, lots of projects use submodules, so it's a bit flakey, and a bit abusive, but the reasoning behind it was to avoid having ,git artefacts in the (probably) webroot

2013-12-05 02:21:37	motaka2	Kartagis: I want to add all foo.bar
2013-12-05 02:21:46	dtrott	damccull: Take a look at the file .git/refs/heads/master
2013-12-05 02:21:47	flujan	dr_lepper: is it possible to delete files and it history which are not presente on the current HEAD?
2013-12-05 02:21:54	Kartagis	motaka2: if you use git add ^foo.bar$, that's really the same as git add foo.bar
2013-12-05 02:22:00	dtrott	A branch is just a SHA pointing to a commt.
2013-12-05 02:22:11	damccull	cool

2013-12-05 06:22:06	LionKing	but I think the EAP files are not compressed
2013-12-05 06:22:20	mediawork	LionKing, are EAP files binary?
2013-12-05 06:22:39	LionKing	yes, in fact, they are MS Access database files
2013-12-05 06:22:58	mediawork	LionKing, oh, how big were those files typically?
2013-12-05 06:23:06	LionKing	2 - 5 MiB
2013-12-05 06:23:12	mediawork	ok,

2013-12-05 06:27:15	mediawork	LionKing, _ikke_ , looks like  delta compression is exactly what you would want to ensure compression of changes between binary files.
2013-12-05 06:27:24	_ikke_	bweston: If you add an echo to the hook, you don't get any output back?
2013-12-05 06:27:57	_ikke_	mediawork: Note that deltacompression is only used in pack files. Git creates new objects in the filesystem, until gc has run (which happens every so often)

2013-12-05 10:00:37	fobius	I'm a little confused by git checkout <branch>. Here is how I understand it: move HEAD to point at <branch> and keeping any changes in the working tree and the state of the index unless we can't switch without "losing" some of the local changes in the working directory - in that case, refuse to checkout. Is that right?

2013-12-05 10:04:32	fobius	kpreid: That's where I'm confused I think. For instance, If I add some file to the index, delete that file from the working tree, and then switch branches then that file remains added in the index. However, if I first commit the file I added and then switch branches it doesn't follow me. But the file is in the index either way, right?

2013-12-05 10:05:45	kpreid	fobius: right. so what it's doing is not keeping the *state* of the working tree and index but keeping the *changes* in the working tree and index, relative to HEAD

2013-12-05 10:06:59	fobius	kpreid: Mmk, maybe I just needed to hear that explicitly. It says that it keeps around the changes to the working tree on the man page but it kind of brushes under the rug that the changes to the index relative to old-HEAD will also be kept in the index.

2013-12-05 10:07:36	kpreid	well, the rule to keep in mind is that checkout <branch> is non-destructive, i.e. reversible
2013-12-05 10:07:44	kpreid	if it didn't keep index state that wouldn't be true
2013-12-05 10:07:55	kpreid	now, how you learn this properly, I have no advice on.

2013-12-05 10:08:25	fobius	kpreid: It just seems a little unintuitive because if I stage some changes I probably intended to stage those changes for branch that I'm on. If I switch branches with stages changed it's probably because I forgot to commit
2013-12-05 10:08:44	fobius	Now I'm going to accidentally commit those changes on the wrong branch and have to do a bunch of work to get them back out
2013-12-05 10:08:50	kpreid	that seems fair
2013-12-05 10:09:03	kpreid	you can get them onto the proper branch with a cherry-pick, fwiw

2013-12-05 11:36:43	JesseC	_ikke_: so the branch where the files were modified show the CRLF being replaced, but when you checkout another branch shouldn't it return those files to the state they were in on that branch?

2013-12-05 16:16:37	imachuchu	leo-the-manic: it's not damage control, it's just cleaning up. Branches are just easy references to commits, when you delete them you are telling git that those commits aren't important anymore.

2013-12-05 16:25:02	jrnieder	sometimes multiple topics are intermixed, but each commit has to do with one topic

While it is possible to use git with repositories that are managed by repo, it is not always easy. http://source.android.com/source/version-control.html

2013-12-05 21:25:18	twb	OK here's the real question: I have a repo that builds a live CD.  I'm git cloning the repo into the CD so I know how it was built.  The entire CD is subjected to xz -9 compression, so if the git clone uses no zlib, it should result in a smaller CD overall.

2013-12-05 21:30:41	JamesNZ	So I just did something really stupid, I accidentally deleted a whole bunch of files (some unpushed) from my local repo. None of it was really vital or anything that I had changed fairly recently. Would the best way to recover be to run git pull?
2013-12-05 21:31:28	twb	If they're deleted from the working tree, you can "git checkout foo.c" to get it back

2013-12-06 09:16:47	gaspar|work	Hey, we just started using git in our team couple of weeks ago. When we add features to the website we create a separate brach (like "NewAPIStructure" or "ShoppingCartRedesign"), then we do testing by checking this branch and after bug fixes branch gets merged to master.
2013-12-06 09:17:10	+bamj0rb	PerlJam: Well you can already invoke system commands with little effort. And from the looks of it, the wrapper is barely specific to Git. Looks like just a bit of enviroment setup and then system command helpers (like handling failure).
2013-12-06 09:17:17	gaspar|work	So currently we have 40+ merged branches that show up bitbucket, how can we get rid of them?
2013-12-06 09:17:35	+bamj0rb	PerlJam: It doesn't look like it shields you from API changes, etc. So you might as well invoke git directly.

2013-12-06 09:18:14	canton7	gaspar|work, you delete them once they're merged in
2013-12-06 09:18:20	canton7	man git push --delete, man git branch -d, etc
2013-12-06 09:18:20	@gitinfo	the git-push manpage is available at http://jk.gs/git-push.html
2013-12-06 09:18:20	@gitinfo	the git-branch manpage is available at http://jk.gs/git-branch.html
2013-12-06 09:18:59	gaspar|work	canton7: Cool, we didn't know if it was safe to delete branches, better ask before destroying repo! Thanks!

2013-12-06 10:07:06	sjohnson	hi.  one thing i've noticed is that when I stash something and pop it later, if there is no merge conflict, then everything is as it was.  but if there is a merge conflict, it "git adds" every file that was stashed... meaning that "git diff" no longer shows anything, i have to do git diff HEAD, etc.

Read "How to resolve conflicts" in man git-merge and http://git-scm.com/book/ch3-2.html#Basic-Merge-Conflicts then carefully go through the conflicts.

2013-12-06 10:14:19	fobius	Workflow question: What if anything would be wrong with - as an alternative to using submodules - cloning repos underneath the parent and just adding all of those repos to the .gitignore file for the parent? That way they really are separate entities that are just being used in the parent. This seems honest to me - more honest than using submodules which cause a lot of problems (or so I hear).

This can happen if you a) check out a tag, remote tracking branch, or SHA; or b) if you are in a submodule; or you are in the middle of a c) am or d) rebase that is stuck/conflicted. See !reattach

2013-12-06 13:21:43	EGreg	just researching
2013-12-06 13:21:48	EGreg	mercurial recently added phases
2013-12-06 13:22:06	+bamj0rb	Not that recently. I think it has probably been a couple of years already.
2013-12-06 13:22:28	canton7	someone brought it up on the git mailing list a while back, with the aim of preventing people from accidentally pushing branches which were meant to be private-only, but it was deemed unnecessary
2013-12-06 13:22:31	+bamj0rb	Though I think it is relatively recently that they figured out what to do with them. :)
2013-12-06 13:22:36	SamB	what's a phase?
2013-12-06 13:22:46	_ikke_	SamB: A state of a set of commits

2013-12-06 13:23:21	+bamj0rb	SamB: It's like a status flag on a commit. Tells Mercurial whether it is in draft (a wip), secret (not to be shared), or whatever the "open" one is (meaning it can be shared).
2013-12-06 13:23:32	_ikke_	public
2013-12-06 13:24:09	+bamj0rb	That is because in Mercurial, 'hg push' means push ALL THE THINGS.
2013-12-06 13:24:21	_ikke_	Not necessarily
2013-12-06 13:24:25	SamB	didn't git change to semething like that by default

2013-12-06 13:25:00	_ikke_	In git, you would implement a sane workflow
2013-12-06 13:25:07	+bamj0rb	The Git way is generally to push only the specific thing you are on right now. I don't think that behavior has changed, but there is a config option to tell it to push everything.
2013-12-06 13:26:01	imachuchu	EGreg: does all of this answer your question?
2013-12-06 13:26:05	canton7	the old default was to push everything which had already been pushed at some point. the new default is to only push the current branch, and only under certain conditions

2013-12-06 13:26:46	+bamj0rb	Ah, looks like the default is to now push "matching" branches. Yeah, I'll stick with "upstream", I think.

2013-12-07 22:32:39	lotus	Hey, I committed a bunch of code without first diff'ing it and checking for errors.  I pushed the commit, but I know that noone else has a copy of it (except the remote GitLab server?) -- I want to "undo" the last commit, but I want to get my working directory back so that I might add the files, diff, and then re-commit.

2013-12-07 22:33:09	lotus	I think I want to use git revert?
2013-12-07 22:33:23	lotus	but I'm not sure how to do it corretly, and I didn't want to risk my work.
2013-12-07 22:33:33	offby1	git revert will certainly work.
2013-12-07 22:33:35	krasnus	as soon as it is pushed, you should consider it irreversible
2013-12-07 22:34:03	SamB	well, revert will make your mistake visible to everyone but it won't really do any harm
2013-12-07 22:34:03	offby1	krasnus: depends.  If lotus has few coworkers, and they're forgiving :-)  he/she might well want to "force push".
2013-12-07 22:34:08	offby1	I've done it.
2013-12-07 22:34:23	krasnus	sure, but that's hardly reliable
2013-12-07 22:34:29	offby1	*shrug&
2013-12-07 22:34:35	lotus	I'm not worried about getting rid of the commit, but I do want to have my working directory back the way it was before the commit so that I might diff the changes, fix anything (like extra spaces, etc) and then commit the fixes
2013-12-07 22:34:56	offby1	there are costs and benefits to everything; I'm just saying that the cost of a "force push" is well less than infinite :)
2013-12-07 22:35:05	SamB	I force-pushed once when I misspelled a co-volunteer's name in the subject line of a commit message ...

2013-12-08 09:29:25	Celelaptop	Hi
2013-12-08 09:29:39	Celelaptop	I did my first git push today. A few minutes ago.

2013-12-08 09:30:11	offby1	/ \
2013-12-08 09:30:12	Celelaptop	I don't understand what's the warning about push.default.
2013-12-08 09:30:14	Celelaptop	:)
2013-12-08 09:30:29	Celelaptop	I think it's about the branches to be pushed.
2013-12-08 09:30:33	offby1	yeah
2013-12-08 09:30:42	Celelaptop	I guess "matching" push only the branches with a matching name.
2013-12-08 09:30:47	charon	cwillu_at_work: i don't think you can set it as a default. why would that be useful. half the time git-diff would be lying to you ;-) i could see why you'd want -D by default, though, so maybe you can make a case for that on the !list.

2013-12-08 09:30:54	offby1	when you type "git push" with no further arguments, it's not blindingly obvious which branches you want to push, go git guesses.
2013-12-08 09:30:56	Celelaptop	And what does "simple"?
2013-12-08 09:31:20	offby1	I _think_ that argument means that git is planning on changing how it guesses in an upcoming version, so you'd better get into the habit of being more explicit.
2013-12-08 09:31:27	offby1	s/argument/warning/
2013-12-08 09:31:34	Celelaptop	It has already changed, say the warning.
2013-12-08 09:31:39	offby1	oh.
2013-12-08 09:31:44	Celelaptop	Hum...
2013-12-08 09:31:46	Celelaptop	"is changing".
2013-12-08 09:31:50	cwillu_at_work	charon, I look at git stat when I care about which files changed; when I look at git diff, I'm _always_ looking at specific changes, and a 2000 line removal in the middle of a dozen 12 line changes is not useful here
2013-12-08 09:32:02	offby1	Celelaptop: I haven't seen that warning in a while.  Maybe you should paste it

2013-12-08 16:11:51	grawity	then this elisp needs to be rewired to a) explicitly disable a pager, or b) do not invoke git with a tty attached

2013-12-08 16:12:14	grawity	git does not check $TERM; if stdout is a tty, it invokes a pager.

2013-12-09 08:55:02	vak	'git branch -avv' gives me [origin/master: ahead 1] ... for my tracked branch, However 'git push origin' says there is nothing to push. Why do I see then this 'ahead 1' ?
2013-12-09 08:55:26	ojacobson	'git push origin' doesn't do what you think it does :)
2013-12-09 08:55:48	waruii	git pull might
2013-12-09 08:55:51	waruii	;)
2013-12-09 08:55:57	ojacobson	the actual behaviour depends on the push.default config value, but the default will be to pairwise match branches locally and on origin, *by name* (not by tracking info)
2013-12-09 08:55:59	ojacobson	and push the matches
2013-12-09 08:56:07	ojacobson	which is very unlikely to be what you want
2013-12-09 08:56:26	vak	ojacobson: waruii: i did 'git pull' as well

2013-12-09 08:57:58	ojacobson	anyways, the formal answer is "you see 'ahead 1' because your local branch is set to track origin/master, and contains one commit not contained in origin/master"
2013-12-09 08:58:01	ojacobson	which is maybe not helpful
2013-12-09 08:58:04	ojacobson	but is at least true
2013-12-09 08:58:14	vak	git pull ==> Already up-to-date. git push ==> Everything up-to-date. and still 'ahead 1'...
2013-12-09 08:58:47	ojacobson	back up a step and talk about your goals

2013-12-09 09:47:26	Silex	hello, I'm using the classic gitflow develop/master paradigm, and I bumped into an issue I'm not sure how to solve: I have an old maintainance branch for some tagged release on master. I'm currently doing a topic branch on develop which changes would theorically also apply to this old branch

2013-12-09 10:01:02	lisak	hey, is there any problem with deleting corrupted (diverged) branch from upstream and pushing new one that I restored from other branch locally
2013-12-09 10:01:56	ojacobson	lisak: it's equivalent to force-pushing your branch

Everyone who has pulled the old history have to do work (and you'll have to tell them to), so it's infinitely better to just move on. If you must, you can use `git push -f` to force (and the remote may reject that, anyway). See http://goo.gl/waqum

It's better to ask what branches can do rather than what they're *for*, because everyone uses it slightly differently.

If the files you changed differ between branches, the checkout will fail.  In that case, `git stash` then checkout, and `git stash apply` and go through normal conflict resolution.

2013-12-09 11:15:42	imachuchu	osse: there is, it's the root of the repo. Branches just share commits until they diverge and an interactive rebase just changes commits in the range you specify

2013-12-09 13:15:09	phy1729	I have my dotfiles at bitbucket currently; I want to move them to github. I want to keep the history but entirely purge the .gist-vim file first. How can I purge the file?
2013-12-09 13:15:29	+bamj0rb	git filter-branch?
2013-12-09 13:15:46	 *	bamj0rb has never heard of a .gist-vim file.
2013-12-09 13:16:20	@gitinfo	Worried about your data while trying out stuff in your repo? To back up commit history on all branches/tags: `git clone --mirror`. To backup everything, including work tree and staging area: `tar cf repo-backup.tar repodir`. Or do your experiment in a throwaway clone instead. See also http://sethrobertson.github.com/GitBestPractices/#backups
2013-12-09 13:16:20	@gitinfo	[!rewriting_public_history] Rewriting public history is usually bad. Everyone who has pulled the old history have to do work (and you'll have to tell them to), so it's infinitely better to just move on. If you must, you can use `git push -f` to force (and the remote may reject that, anyway). See http://goo.gl/waqum

Just to be clear the origin repo was created as a bare repo.  so on a new directory I clone the repo (git clone user@server:path/to/repo.git) then I checkout the develop branch (git checkout -b develop), then git status shows nothing

2013-12-09 16:53:30	skorgon	platzhirsch, you have to choose the action for each commit and then write the file and close the editor. then git goes and starts the actual rebase

2013-12-09 16:56:03	@gitinfo	platzhirsch: [!rewriting_public_history] Rewriting public history is usually bad. Everyone who has pulled the old history have to do work (and you'll have to tell them to), so it's infinitely better to just move on. If you must, you can use `git push -f` to force (and the remote may reject that, anyway). See http://goo.gl/waqum

2013-12-10 10:59:42	gxti	cdehaan: technically then you've already met your request
2013-12-10 10:59:57	gxti	you have a repo with your changes on top of it, and in the future you can pull new changes from upstream and merge them
2013-12-10 11:00:15	cdehaan	gxti: But when I do that, then git push only pushes my changes, not all the files in the directory
2013-12-10 11:00:27	cdehaan	gxti: Because git add . is only capturing the files I changed, when I really want ALL files added
2013-12-10 11:00:47	fobius	So, I have a folder in a repo which corresponds to another git repo (i.e. a subtree). I made some changes in the subtree but it has a common ancestor with the original repo (when I originally added it). However, when I do git merge -Xsubtree=bundle/mySubtree it's spitting up conflicts. It shouldn't be doing this right? It has a common ancestor so it should be like a fast forward.
2013-12-10 11:00:52	gxti	cdehaan: well you do it on top of the cloned repo, not in a new one
2013-12-10 11:01:00	ojacobson	cdehaan: your impression of what 'git add' is doing is inaccurate
2013-12-10 11:01:24	cdehaan	Ok, so how do I do what I want?
2013-12-10 11:01:24	ojacobson	git stores snapshots, not deltas; 'git add' says "when I next commit, make the snapshot look like this _for the entire project_". The new commit will contain the entire source tree.

2013-12-10 11:02:09	gxti	just clone the repo, make your changes, commit them, done
2013-12-10 11:02:18	cdehaan	Maybe I'm not being clear.

2013-12-10 11:02:49	cdehaan	When I do what I've described, it ends up pushing only the file that I changed, Procfile
2013-12-10 11:02:53	ojacobson	No.

2013-12-10 11:03:16	ojacobson	That's flatly untrue. You can verify it with eg. 'git ls-tree HEAD' after committing your changes, and observing that it contains the entire repo, not just Procfile.

2013-12-10 11:05:43	ojacobson	Yeah, probably. Odds are I missed something in your description.
2013-12-10 11:05:48	grawity	cdehaan: Git only tracks files that it was told to track – so if you erased the old repository in .git/ and `git init`-ed a new one, then Git is starting fresh and you have to add all files to the repo
2013-12-10 11:05:55	ojacobson	Git's definitely snapshot-based, though, so what you're trying to do is actually p easy :)

2013-12-10 11:07:10	cdehaan	Ok, for now I just emptied .gitignore since I've already got the repo set up, looks like what I should've done was just 'git remote add', however
2013-12-10 11:07:40	gxti	depending on how much stuff you're planning to add and whether you want to modify the upstream stuff, submodules might also be of interest

2013-12-10 11:12:14	JesseC	Does anyone know a way to checkout LF and commit LF in Windows? I've read just about every document I can find on line endings, but the problem I'm having is that the three options available to core.autocrlf don't cover my scenario. I checkout my repo on Windows, but need LF line endings because the files I'm editing are hosted in a Linux vagrant that requires LF endings. autocrlf=true changes
2013-12-10 11:12:14	JesseC	them to crlf when you checkout in windows, input commits with LF endings, but leaves crlf in windows and false won't convert to LF on commit.
2013-12-10 11:13:16	grawity	'input' commits with LF, but does no conversion when checking out

2013-12-10 11:15:06	ToxicFrog	I mean, if the files are LF in the repo, you should be able to check them out without conversion, edit them with LF, and check them in with LF, unless your editor is broken.

2013-12-10 12:16:57	petey	thanks jrnieder, I went over these but figured there's gotta be some sweet workflows out there
2013-12-10 12:17:06	schemanic	I am confused about how connecting to gitlab from multiple computers works insofar as SSH keys are concerned
2013-12-10 12:17:22	schemanic	gitlab is like github but is self hosted
2013-12-10 12:17:23	schemanic	same thing
2013-12-10 12:17:50	SamB	having loaded an object into RAM, how does git ever unload it before termination?
2013-12-10 12:17:54	schemanic	Is one meant to generate a separate ssh key/password for every machine that will access the repository?
2013-12-10 12:18:11	yaymukund	petey: http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/ that's a good starting point. there's also the flow they use at github
2013-12-10 12:18:15	jrnieder	petey: my team at work is ~ 6 people. we use gerrit (https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/)
2013-12-10 12:18:22	ojacobson	generally, yeah, users should have a key for each host they connect *from* -- the alternative is to move keys around, which increases the risk that those keys will be compromised

2013-12-10 12:19:11	petey	jrnieder gerrit looks awesome, especially with the code review! thanks
2013-12-10 12:19:17	petey	yaymukund that is a great article, thank you
2013-12-10 12:19:23	schemanic	ojacobson, is it common for github to be set up to automatically push code out once someone has committed?
2013-12-10 12:19:24	SamB	and anyway generating a key per userXhost is the easiest way to work on *nix
2013-12-10 12:19:45	schemanic	SamB, I'm on windows
2013-12-10 12:19:46	ojacobson	schemanic: I've no opinion. Automatic deploys are both common and unusual.
2013-12-10 12:19:52	schemanic	hmm
2013-12-10 12:19:56	ojacobson	I would mediate it through something like jenkins, at least
2013-12-10 12:20:02	ojacobson	so that you can easily turn it on/off
2013-12-10 12:20:02	schemanic	what is jenkins?
2013-12-10 12:20:09	SamB	or, should I say with openssh
2013-12-10 12:20:16	ojacobson	a continuous integration/build automation system
2013-12-10 12:20:27	ojacobson	which can be pressed into service as a job runner for various sorts of things
2013-12-10 12:21:22	yaymukund	petey: if you're looking for a whole code review/deployment system built on top of git, I like phabricator (though I've used it with a team of ~15 so I don't know how it would scale down).
2013-12-10 12:21:26	schemanic	when we say 'build', could that be as simple as 'check out a copy of the most recent code to this location'?
2013-12-10 12:22:04	 *	SamB wonders why "git ls-remote .|cut -f2|git cat-file --batch=$'%(objectname)\t%(objecttype)'|less" is complaining about the very first object having changed size ...
2013-12-10 12:22:32	schemanic	All I want to do at this point in time is push my code out to where it's supposed to live on the network when I make a commit from my local repo
2013-12-10 12:22:57	SamB	(I just ran fsck and it made no such complaint!)
2013-12-10 12:22:57	petey	ah okay cool yaymukund, i'll take a look. i didnt realize there were systems like this out there so ill have to do some research
2013-12-10 12:23:23	SamB	schemanic: some of us are liking to check our commits before pushing

2013-12-10 12:26:12	schemanic	SamB, I'm a bit confused. If I understand correctly, without any other tools in the mix, the way one 'normally' does it is to develop and push code to origin on one machine, test it there, then log into the production server and run git pull on the repo from there?
2013-12-10 12:27:20	schemanic	is that correct?

2013-12-10 17:26:51	@gitinfo	A detached HEAD(aka "no branch") occurs when your HEAD does not point at a branch. New commits will NOT be added to any branch, and can easily be !lost. This can happen if you a) check out a tag, remote tracking branch, or SHA; or b) if you are in a submodule; or you are in the middle of a c) am or d) rebase that is stuck/conflicted. See !reattach

2013-12-11 08:32:31	Sigma	hey, I have a colleague who has a weird problem with git on windows. basically in our repo there's a branch "foo" and a branch "Foo". Each time they git fetch origin, they see alternately "* [new branch] foo -> origin/foo" or "* [new branch] Foo -> origin/Foo". So it looks like foo clobbers Foo, then Foo clobbers foo, and so on. does that ring any bell? (the strange thing is that we can't reproduce it on other

Is there some parameter I can pass to rebase to make sure that whenever there's a conflict it applies changes such that the affected file ends up identical in content to the one on the branch that is being rebased?

2013-12-11 09:37:41	lmat	dglambert: it's centralized, so you have to be online to do anything interesting with version control.
2013-12-11 09:37:55	dglambert	lmat, pros
2013-12-11 09:37:58	lmat	dglambert: It offers a global branch/tag space... Branches/tags are simply copies..
2013-12-11 09:37:58	dglambert	lol
2013-12-11 09:38:10	lmat	dglambert: these are features. If you like them, they're pros ^_^
2013-12-11 09:38:31	lmat	dglambert: If you put anything in any repository, everyone can see what you did.
2013-12-11 09:38:35	dglambert	lmat, can you expand on the second one?

The topic has links with more information about git and this channel. NB. it can't hurt to do a backup (type !backup for help) before trying things out, especially if they involve dangerous keywords such as --hard, clean, --force/-f, rm and so on.

The topic has links with more information about git and this channel. NB. it can't hurt to do a backup (type !backup for help) before trying things out, especially if they involve dangerous keywords such as --hard, clean, --force/-f, rm and so on.

2013-12-11 15:29:31	Crell	Hi folks. Hopefully easy question. I've a server with a bare git rep at ~/archive/repo.git.  I want to clone that repo over SSH.  I'm not clear on what the right URI is for it, though.
2013-12-11 15:29:42	canton7	random_jt, the former transfers data over ssh, the latter over a custom protocol. ssh requires authentication and is encrypted. git:// doesn't and isn't. ssh allows pushing. git:// can, but due to that lack of authentication it's a really bad idea

2013-12-11 15:30:44	canton7	there's a 'git urls' section in man git-clone, though it isn't massively helpful on that point

2013-12-11 15:33:35	m0viefreak	and specify the port there manually

2013-12-12 08:44:29	@gitinfo	tty4: hi! I'd like to automatically welcome you to #git, a place full of helpful gits. Got a question? Just ask it — chances are someone will answer fairly soon. The topic has links with more information about git and this channel. NB. it can't hurt to do a backup (type !backup for help) before trying things out, especially if they involve dangerous keywords such as --hard, clean, --force/-f, rm and so on.

2013-12-12 09:45:03	llaskin	and to do a "update"  I have to do a "checkout" in git right?

2013-12-12 09:45:54	+bamj0rb	llaskin: Git is distributed, which means that there are multiple "up-to-dates". You need to explicitly tell Git what your idea of up-to-date is.

2013-12-12 09:46:40	+bamj0rb	llaskin: In practice, what that does is fetch the changes from a remote repository, and *merge* them into your current branch.

2013-12-12 12:27:57	davidfic	I was pushing for the 1 repo idea as it seems to simplify things
2013-12-12 12:28:24	muep	davidfic: yes. and either you then make the C change and then release a new version of the C component and then document that the version of the C component has to be least X.Y or suchlike
2013-12-12 12:28:39	+bamj0rb	davidfic: You could use submodules to track it, but it sounds like unnecessary overhead. It sounds like the code is 1:1 related.

2013-12-12 12:33:03	+bamj0rb	davidfic: If it is different people working on each "component" then perhaps it would make sense to separate it. The communication would happen outside the repo.
2013-12-12 12:33:03	+bamj0rb	davidfic: If it's the same person changing both then it might as well be in the same repo.
2013-12-12 12:33:03	muep	davidfic: having them in different repos mostly just helps when it is useful to mix different versions of them
2013-12-12 12:33:03	davidfic	i need to try and push back it seems and get things in the same repo rather then try to write a series of scripts to keep  things in sync
2013-12-12 12:33:03	muep	davidfic: but really if there is no stable interface in the lower level pieces, you might be better off considering them integral parts of the higher level stuff

2013-12-12 12:33:03	+bamj0rb	Alternatively, if any of the components are ever used by completely different projects (e.g., a shared library with common code unrelated to this current product) then it might make sense to keep that separate.
2013-12-12 12:33:03	davidfic	yea, it's one product. all the repos combine to make our product that we ship to customers

2013-12-12 18:29:35	RobinBAwesome	so if i delete my .git directory for any reason, i can get a new one by doing git init adding origin as the remote, and then pulling. however, this gets rid of all my uncommitted changes for some reason. does anybody know how i might save them?

2013-12-12 20:16:14	jim	so it stands to reason pushing wasn't designed (or at least not built) for that

2013-12-12 20:18:12	jim	so when I first came to understand that, I created a setup where the middle thing was a bare repo, and then I could push to it and pull from it

2013-12-16 11:17:35	skorgon	jonathanwallace, well, since the end result is the same it just comes down to what you find easier to work with, i guess. for cherry-picking you need an extra branch - one to pick from and one to apply on (well, strictly speaking you wouldn't need one, but I assume one is used). rebase just alters your current branch without any intermediate step - but you "lose" (it remainsl in the reflog) the branch you
2013-12-16 11:17:38	skorgon	started from.

2013-12-17 09:19:32	ojacobson	Mattx: commit time is not a function of repo size, it's a function of tree size
2013-12-17 09:19:46	ojacobson	"a big .git" should generally not cause slow commits; something else is probably in play
2013-12-17 09:19:55	+bamj0rb	^ That sounds good to me.

2013-12-17 09:20:09	+bamj0rb	I find that Windows is just slow. At least, compare to *nix.
2013-12-17 09:21:01	+bamj0rb	Combine that with a bad file system format, layout, fragmentation, or what have you and I can see it feeling very slow.

2013-12-18 17:30:42	SamB	I don't really think this is likely to be a very good plan in the first place, really, since it's kind of a pain juggling multiple keys for the same name/email, and signing every commit would surely compromise the safety of the key

2013-12-19 17:27:12	TheColonial	Greetings all. Quick question about submodules.
2013-12-19 17:27:31	TheColonial	Branch A is merging branch B
2013-12-19 17:27:42	TheColonial	B had a new submodule added, say C..
2013-12-19 17:28:08	TheColonial	and when merging A gets a merge conflict that says "Unmerged paths"... and the submodule path is listed as "added by them".

2013-12-19 17:28:21	TheColonial	I can't seem to figure out how to add the submodule without adding the entire submodule source as part of the tree.
2013-12-19 17:28:34	TheColonial	What do I need to do to simply include the submodule in the merge?
2013-12-19 17:28:51	TheColonial	git add <submodule path>   results in the submodule source being added to the index.

2013-12-20 09:45:32	+bamj0rb	kbouwser: What you really did is push commits that break the code? And you want to rewrite the history so that it is as if you never pushed them?

2013-12-20 09:47:54	+bamj0rb	kbouwser: You can use git log to find the "good" commit and simply make that your branch head (e.g., git reset --hard <good_commit_sha1>). And with `git push --force $remote $branch' you could !rewrite the upstream $branch to pretend those commits never existed.
2013-12-20 09:47:55	@gitinfo	kbouwser: [!rewriting_public_history] Rewriting public history is usually bad. Everyone who has pulled the old history have to do work (and you'll have to tell them to), so it's infinitely better to just move on. If you must, you can use `git push -f` to force (and the remote may reject that, anyway). See http://goo.gl/waqum

2013-12-20 12:17:12	cbreak	but I guess that's because I use Mac OS X, the system known for always getting the latest and greatest :D

The topic has links with more information about git and this channel. NB. it can't hurt to do a backup (type !backup for help) before trying things out, especially if they involve dangerous keywords such as --hard, clean, --force/-f, rm and so on.

2013-12-21 17:01:42	clarkk	I need to synchronise a portion of my filesystem that includes many git repos. I am considering using rsync, unison, or sparkleshare, or similar. Is this safe to do? Are there any considerations or dangers that I need to be aware about, please?
2013-12-21 17:01:59	clarkk	if it;s safe, what sync software would you recommend?
2013-12-21 17:02:22	clarkk	*sync between two dev machines
2013-12-21 17:02:30	ahuemer	hi all. can i use the internal git pager without a git command? like $ echo foo | git-pager
2013-12-21 17:02:45	SamB	ahuemer: it doesn't actually have an internal pager
2013-12-21 17:03:09	SamB	it just uses less(1), normally, though it does use a few extra options
2013-12-21 17:03:37	SamB	ahuemer: I think man git-config has the details
2013-12-21 17:03:39	@gitinfo	ahuemer: the git-config manpage is available at http://jk.gs/git-config.html
2013-12-21 17:04:23	ahuemer	oh, i thought there was an internal one. thanks

2013-12-21 17:06:04	grawity	clarkk: Unison should be fine; Dropbox is often problematic, so I'd be careful with Sparkleshare too (since they both sync changes automatically)
2013-12-21 17:06:25	grawity	clarkk: rsync works well if you only go in one direction (A→B)

2013-12-21 17:07:42	clarkk	hi grawity. Thanks for your response. I need it in both directions, unfortunately
2013-12-21 17:07:54	grawity	clarkk: then Unison would be better
2013-12-21 17:08:16	clarkk	grawity: Can you think of any states or situations in a git repo (ie where they are in different branches or commits) where  synching would corrupt it?

2013-12-21 17:08:41	clarkk	grawity: what does unison do differently, in brief layman's terms ;)
2013-12-21 17:09:05	grawity	Unison was written to sync in both directions, for one
2013-12-21 17:09:15	ahuemer	thanks again. bye
2013-12-21 17:09:17	<--	ahuemer (ahuemer@unaffiliated/ahuemer) has left #git
2013-12-21 17:09:46	grawity	it also keeps persistent state on both computers, so it knows which files were renamed, which were deleted on both sides, and so on
2013-12-21 17:10:05	grawity	as for corruption...
2013-12-21 17:10:17	grawity	sync basically means that both computers will end up with the exact same files
2013-12-21 17:11:14	bekks	clarkk: Why dont both computers just use the same repo?
2013-12-21 17:11:14	grawity	so if the same repo on A and B was on different branches, then one of them will be switched to whatever the other one has
2013-12-21 17:11:40	-->	thiago (~thiago@kde/thiago) has joined #git
2013-12-21 17:11:46	clarkk	grawity: so I need to make sure that sync is complete before starting working with a repo on the other machine?
2013-12-21 17:11:49	grawity	though, depending on the initial sync, the working directory may get messed up (have files from both commits/branches)
2013-12-21 17:11:58	grawity	clarkk: generally, yes
2013-12-21 17:12:27	grawity	it is okay to sync .git/objects/ pretty much anytime assuming the sync first copies new files, and only then deletes old ones
2013-12-21 17:12:44	grawity	but the rest of the repository shouldn't probably be synced if you're actively using it
2013-12-21 17:12:44	clarkk	ok, that should be easy enough
2013-12-21 17:13:21	clarkk	grawity: what do you mean by that, please?

2013-12-22 14:35:53	saq	hi all, first time using git (and products like it in gneral) using gitblit on windows as my central server and ive got the base stood up
2013-12-22 14:36:05	saq	im trying to use it for a distributed team source control for a web server
2013-12-22 14:36:29	saq	i want to make it so when we do a push to prod it copies the files on the server out to prod
2013-12-22 14:36:46	saq	not really sure what terminology etc i shoudl be looking for to help me find any guides
2013-12-22 14:37:20	arand	!deploy I guess
2013-12-22 14:37:20	@gitinfo	Git is not a deployment tool, but you can build one around it (in simple environments) or use it as an object store(for complex ones). Here are some options/ideas to get you started: http://gitolite.com/deploy.html

2013-12-23 09:44:06	cbreak	in a database, you have to first query it, and then decode that file's data

2013-12-23 09:45:05	ojacobson	let's not confuse the access interface (query language, name lookup, raw device address, whatever) and the way the data appears to other apps
2013-12-23 09:45:23	ojacobson	git does use a database, whose primary index structure is implemented directly onto the underlying filesystem's directory mechanism

2013-12-23 09:45:34	solrize	hmm i'm used to filesystems having more overhead but maybe, ok, i can see it, the file system is sort of a nosql-ish key-value store keyed by filename
2013-12-23 09:45:36	cbreak	git uses the filesystem (or pack files)
2013-12-23 09:45:44	ojacobson	that it stores its data as loose files instead of as a single file broken up internally into pages is only relevant because it shits up your du(1) output
2013-12-23 09:45:44	cbreak	databases add database overhead on top of that
2013-12-23 09:45:52	cbreak	more overhead -> less speed
2013-12-23 09:45:56	ojacobson	exclude .git from du and you won't care any more. Also, du -s.

2013-12-23 10:30:42	_ikke_	Does what carles mentioned
2013-12-23 10:30:51	carles	seems that the 3 solutions calls git log per each file. I have mine working (from Python) but it's inefficient

2013-12-23 10:31:18	_ikke_	One optimization is caching commits
2013-12-23 10:32:00	osse	best way is probably to call git log once with name-only and then continue reading the log until all files are covered
2013-12-23 10:32:40	_ikke_	I'm not sure what's faster

2013-12-23 10:32:57	carles	osse: this is what i'm going to do. "git log" is much faster than what i'm doing atm
2013-12-23 10:33:00	Nevik	carles: you want data that git doesnt save in that direction, so any solution will be quite inefficient
2013-12-23 10:33:41	Nevik	if you want this often and for man repos, you can keep a cache and hook scripts, i guess
2013-12-23 10:33:45	osse	carles: yep, should be fast enough. start off with a list of all current files and then "tick the off" as you read git-log output
2013-12-23 10:33:52	Nevik	dont know how complete you can make that regarding branch switches though
2013-12-23 10:34:14	Nevik	(going more into the direction of how github does it)
2013-12-23 10:34:14	carles	git log --name-only > /dev/null takes seconds. My current approach with about 6000 calls there is much slower... will try it now

2013-12-23 14:55:54	+simpleminds	performance wise however

2013-12-23 15:03:50	solrize	i made a repo with about 1e4 revisions of one file, and it got pretty bloated and slow, and i ran git gc etc. which sped it up and made the repo a lot smaller

2013-12-23 15:05:30	thiago	it doesn't impact the packed objects either, so it creates a couple of files on disk

2013-12-23 15:05:30	thiago	if there's any trouble, it's your filesystem being slow

2013-12-23 15:18:34	imachuchu	Vivekananda: so your deployed server wouldn't ever need to push back to the main repo, right?
2013-12-23 15:18:34	tomkel5	Hi... silly question... what's a reason that git might think a file has changed all it's lines, when they're actually all the same? git diff shows all lines in red with (-) signs, and then the same lines in green with (+) signs
2013-12-23 15:19:09	_ikke_	tomkel5: !crlf

2013-12-23 15:19:24	tomkel5	I'm assuming it's something to do with the CR/LF situation (I'm on Ubuntu)... but I've tried the core.autocrlf thing, and it doesn't seem to fix it

2013-12-24 13:33:05	tieTYT	why does git status section that says, "Changes not staged for commit" contain files that have already been modified before?
2013-12-24 13:33:15	tieTYT	modified before = committed before
2013-12-24 13:33:33	Vivekananda	I did git checkout temp right after I had deleted the rebase-merge and I moved ot the temp branch
2013-12-24 13:33:37	tieTYT	is that expected behavior?  I've got to add files that have been added and committed in the past?

2013-12-24 13:36:05	imachuchu	Vivekananda: an orphan branch is one that's disconnected from your main history. Your main history is remote/master, you then have a seperate, disconnected, history on master. This second history is called an orphan branch (although it's actually a whole seperate tree)

2013-12-24 13:36:50	tieTYT	gotcha ok
2013-12-24 13:37:19	tieTYT	using svn as an analogy, this is different behavior.  In svn once you modify a committed file, it's automatically staged
2013-12-24 13:37:21	_ikke_	tieTYT: http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository

2013-12-24 13:38:12	Vivekananda	I assumed that all branches will be displayed by the command git branch
2013-12-24 13:38:14	_ikke_	That typically means everything you change goes into the next commit (unless you explicitly list files)

2013-12-24 13:40:53	Vivekananda	_ikke_: I was only using "orphan branch" as imachuchu mentioned. I assumed that on issuing git branch I will see the list of all branches, orphaned or not
2013-12-24 13:41:15	_ikke_	git branch shows all branches under refs/heads
2013-12-24 13:41:55	imachuchu	it shows all local branches, it won't show remote branches (so safeview_wwwHttp/master won't be shown)

2013-12-24 13:44:24	vadi	Hi. I'm following the subtree merge strategy at https://help.github.com/articles/working-with-subtree-merge and have ran into a complication. When someone clones a repository with a subtree-merged remote in it, do they need to set it up again? It seems that the remote point does not also get cloned. I tried replicating the steps after working, but I'm getting a "error: Entry 'blah' overlaps with 'blah'.  Cannot bind." when doing the read-tree command.

2013-12-25 12:30:13	Heimdall	I'm working on a branch 'B', my work is not finished and I suddenly have to fix a bug in another branch

2013-12-25 12:31:04	Heimdall	I don't want to commit on branch 'B' right now because it does not correspond to the end of my work there… but I have to go to that other branch and fix the bug
2013-12-25 12:31:04	Heimdall	what should I do?
2013-12-25 12:31:18	+Bombe	Heimdall, git stash.
2013-12-25 12:31:27	Heimdall	commit anyway, checkout to the other branch, fix the bug, fo back to B and undo the commit ?

2013-12-25 12:39:06	kongthap	moritz, so because of "remote" right??? after pushing to github "git log --all" will keep showing although the commit already  be applied with reset --hard

2013-12-26 10:03:55	+jrnieder	hays: answer depends on those asinine reasons :)
2013-12-26 10:04:04	+ciaranm	you can use submodules to store multiple git repos within a single github private repo

2013-12-26 10:08:42	+jrnieder	it shows up in "git status" but I never "git add" it, so it doesn't do any harm
2013-12-26 10:09:08	+jrnieder	if I were to "git add" it, I'd say "oops" and then "git rm --cached" it

2013-12-27 11:37:54	panzon	hi, I'm new working with git in heterogeneous environment (windows mac linux). My project partners asked me to: set the git configuration parameter core.autocrlf to input. (I work in linux). So reading I understood that I can do it with this command line: "git config --global core.autocrlf input". But I have a doubt, should I run this command each time before using git (adding files, commit.. etc)? or is enough to execute it the first time? Thank you in advance

2013-12-27 11:40:14	+mkienenb	I am new to git.   I have a long history of using cvs/svn.   I have managed to figure out a great deal of things (read through atlassian.com/git/tutorials, user-manual.html,  GitSvnCrashCourse) , but one thing still confuses/frustrates me.   When I clone certain  existing github repositories, I end up with untracked files right away.Maybe it has to do with line endings like panzon mentioned.
2013-12-27 11:41:14	+mkienenb	or worse, modified files
2013-12-27 11:41:27	+mkienenb	Actually, it might have been modified files in both cases
