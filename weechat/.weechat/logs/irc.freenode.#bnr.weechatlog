2012-12-11 13:08:03	@rainbow-zsh	barbecuesteve: connection leak?
2012-12-11 13:08:29	@rainbow-zsh	I do have some channels I have seemingly been unable to leave forever.
2012-12-11 13:09:05	@rainbow-zsh	I blame this in part on the Campfire team, because they let you be in a room more than once, which is a mess.
2012-12-11 13:09:18	@rainbow-zsh	Their backend seemingly doesn't enforce sanity – they rely on all clients to manage that somehow.

2012-12-11 13:27:59	@barbecuesteve	rainbow-zsh: aha. I seem to be in some rooms up to 5x.
2012-12-11 13:28:11	@rainbow-zsh	Yeah.
2012-12-11 13:28:26	@rainbow-zsh	Most of the time, I can log in on the website, enter the room, leave it, enter, leave, over and over, then rejoin from the IRC client.
2012-12-11 13:28:51	@rainbow-zsh	But I have been repeatedly unable to leave this one room. I'm actually surprised that Textual doesn't crash when I get mystery messages from a channel I'm supposedly not in. >_<
2012-12-11 13:29:12	@barbecuesteve	Heh. Do you bounce the camper_van daemon?
2012-12-11 13:29:15	@rainbow-zsh	Nah.
2012-12-11 13:29:34	@rainbow-zsh	Their stupid tab bar on the site also doesn't seem scrollable, so if you're in more than 8 rooms or so, you can't click on them all/get to your account info.
2012-12-11 13:29:51	@rainbow-zsh	I've had to dig through the HTML to get links that aren't visible on screen.
2012-12-11 13:30:46	@rainbow-zsh	Yeah, web UI doesn't even show me in the room, and yet their API keeps sending camper_van messages from the room.
2012-12-11 13:30:49	@rainbow-zsh	Web service fail.

2012-12-12 10:03:35	jblocksom	Actually not necessarily with the history
2012-12-12 10:03:35	@charlietanksley	Can I ask why you don't want the individual commits?
2012-12-12 10:03:54	jblocksom	I don't really see the need to send them to the client
2012-12-12 10:04:06	@charlietanksley	Is the client a developer?
2012-12-12 10:04:11	@charlietanksley	That is, will they be using git?
2012-12-12 10:04:25	@charlietanksley	Or just looking at the filesystem and/or finished product at this point
2012-12-12 10:04:25	@charlietanksley	?
2012-12-12 10:05:15	jblocksom	I don't think they use git
2012-12-12 10:05:23	jblocksom	But they have been doing the builds on their end
2012-12-12 10:05:36	jblocksom	To date the drops have been zip archives
2012-12-12 10:05:38	jblocksom	(no history)
2012-12-12 10:06:01	@charlietanksley	And you want to keep that: just deliever zip archives.
2012-12-12 10:06:10	jblocksom	Not necessarily
2012-12-12 10:06:15	@charlietanksley	(Just trying to get completely clear so I don't steer you wrong.)
2012-12-12 10:06:36	@charlietanksley	But you want to give them the equivalent of a folder of work they can interact with?
2012-12-12 10:06:44	@charlietanksley	Not have them `git pull` from somewhere.
2012-12-12 10:06:59	jblocksom	Yeah, no pulling / pushing
2012-12-12 10:07:03	@charlietanksley	Okay.
2012-12-12 10:07:15	jblocksom	I'm really thinking of something like a release branch
2012-12-12 10:07:30	jblocksom	And then send them just that branch w/ history
2012-12-12 10:07:48	jblocksom	So they could see diffs from release to release
2012-12-12 10:07:57	jblocksom	Arguably I am overcomplicating things :)

2012-12-12 10:29:22	@charlietanksley	So you *don't* want a fast-forward merge.  Hence the --no-ff.
2012-12-12 10:29:25	@charlietanksley	Make sense?
2012-12-12 10:30:25	jblocksom	Sort of
2012-12-12 10:30:30	jblocksom	Apparently I have a detached head now
2012-12-12 10:31:02	@charlietanksley	Did you just checkout a sha?
2012-12-12 10:31:09	@charlietanksley	That just means you aren't on a branch.
2012-12-12 10:31:25	@charlietanksley	create a new one by git checkout -b or go to one that exists by git checkout branch-name.
2012-12-12 10:31:48	jblocksom	I have the new branch from the start
2012-12-12 10:32:29	@charlietanksley	Cool.  Now `git merge --no-ff master`
2012-12-12 10:32:40	@charlietanksley	And add the `-m 'commit message'` if you want one.
2012-12-12 10:33:59	@charlietanksley	jblocksom: try typing gitk in your terminal and then cmd+tab your way to the newly opened application.
2012-12-12 10:34:41	@charlietanksley	That will show you what your branches look like in relation to one another.
2012-12-12 10:34:43	@charlietanksley	That might help.
2012-12-12 10:40:05	jblocksom	Gotta run to a meeting. Thanks Charlie!

2012-12-12 11:39:36	@barbecuesteve	randomstep: $100 rebate if you buy before 12/31.
2012-12-12 11:39:48	@barbecuesteve	I bought two v1s from Lowes. Final cost will be $98 each.
2012-12-12 11:39:53	@randomstep	hmm
2012-12-12 11:39:57	@randomstep	nice.
2012-12-12 11:40:03	@barbecuesteve	(they're currently $229 discounted to $198)
2012-12-12 11:40:07	@randomstep	sweet
2012-12-12 11:40:18	@randomstep	unfortunately doesn't work that well for my current house setup.
2012-12-12 11:40:27	@barbecuesteve	oh, wrong kind of plant?
2012-12-12 11:40:30	@randomstep	still tempting just because of the sweet, sweet tech
2012-12-12 11:40:38	@randomstep	no, just the house layout and activity stuff
2012-12-12 11:40:58	@barbecuesteve	ah.
2012-12-12 11:41:00	@randomstep	multi-split level, thermostat in upstairs hallway, etc
2012-12-12 11:41:18	@barbecuesteve	I woke up this morning to a glitchy thermo upstairs that had been told to heat to 70 and the interior temp was 63.
2012-12-12 11:41:26	@barbecuesteve	Said… well… this is an easy decision.
2012-12-12 11:42:55	@randomstep	ah
2012-12-12 11:42:57	@randomstep	yeah
2012-12-12 11:43:00	@barbecuesteve	So the unboxing is nice. very Apple, with the cardboard and clear plastic.
2012-12-12 11:43:01	@randomstep	especially with the rebate.
2012-12-12 11:43:04	@randomstep	yep.
2012-12-12 11:43:13	@barbecuesteve	Comes with a sweet screwdriver, will bring it in this afternoon.
2012-12-12 11:43:39	@barbecuesteve	Having had a lot of recent HVAC experience, the install was bog-simple, but even for the uninitiated, it was pretty foolproof.
2012-12-12 11:43:45	@barbecuesteve	(spring contacts for the wires)
2012-12-12 11:44:06	@barbecuesteve	Then you create an account on nest.com and it lets you config the device in a browser.
2012-12-12 11:44:55	@barbecuesteve	The web app is great. Really clean, and the warnings about "you need to confirm your e-mail address" and such were done unobtrusively, but you couldnt miss them.
2012-12-12 11:45:27	@barbecuesteve	they built a level into the base so lining it up takes seconds.
2012-12-12 11:46:06	@barbecuesteve	On the downside, my wall now has a big white rectangle with a little round thermostat in it.
2012-12-12 11:47:08	@randomstep	hmm, maybe I can justify as a research expense for building our own web experience for roominant. :)

2012-12-12 11:54:13	@barbecuesteve	funny, you know, her dad was a Baptist minister, so she comes from a non-drinking family.
2012-12-12 11:54:27	@barbecuesteve	I bought a 1.75L of whiskey for $42 and it had a $20 rebate card.
2012-12-12 11:54:40	@barbecuesteve	I told her "Now HERE is a moral dilemma. Will you fill out this rebate form for me?"
2012-12-12 11:54:46	@barbecuesteve	and she was all "Yup! Hand me a pen!"
2012-12-12 11:55:11	@imtzo	Rebates on whiskey.. why is that comical?
2012-12-12 11:55:52	@barbecuesteve	Well, it was, do I disapprove of his drinking and not involve myself, or do I take personal interest and reach for the cash.
2012-12-12 11:55:58	@barbecuesteve	0.006msec later, cash was chosen.

2012-12-12 12:56:20	@rainbow-zsh	kurtisnelson: I've heard tell of folks installing Nests in the EU with 240V line voltage heating/cooling. You just need relays and a transformer is all.
2012-12-12 12:57:01	@rainbow-zsh	Stepdown from line to 24 VAC or whatever Nest wants, rig up relays to switch the line voltage appropriately when the Nest routes power to them, and you now have a Nest-controlled system.
2012-12-12 12:57:41	@rainbow-zsh	(Actually, thermostats might be DC, but still the same idea in spirit.)

2012-12-13 12:01:58	@randomstep	I want something quick. And generally I like the burgers.
2012-12-13 12:02:10	@randomstep	But I haven't been to fox bros, could be persuaded probably
2012-12-13 12:02:46	@randomstep	no else for the #food or #lunch?
2012-12-13 12:03:08	@barbecuesteve	well, fox bros is not very quick.
2012-12-13 12:03:20	greggroth	Fox Bro's is in our neck of the woods.  We could coordinate a meeting of the offices.
2012-12-13 12:03:43	@barbecuesteve	greggroth: it's pretty much precisely in between, if you think about it.
2012-12-13 12:04:02	@randomstep	doing pizza it sounds like
2012-12-13 12:04:06	@barbecuesteve	and in my case, it's a couple blocks from my 1pm haircut, so i'm especially disposed.

2012-12-13 12:06:09	greggroth	I want Fox Bros pulled pork in a Bell St. burrito
2012-12-13 12:06:40	@barbecuesteve	it CAN BE quick, if you're sitting at the bar or going to-go.
2012-12-13 12:07:02	@barbecuesteve	re: excellent, we might be operating on different criteria here. It's pretty good.
2012-12-13 12:09:05	@rainbow-zsh	kurtisnelson: Watch that randomstep/rainbow-zsh tab completion! ;)
2012-12-13 12:09:39	@kurtisnelson	my nick doesn't have BBQ in it so I'll yield.
2012-12-13 12:09:44	@rainbow-zsh	Also for context, barbecuesteve judges competition level barbecue as a hobby, so that's the criteria he's applying. :)
2012-12-13 12:09:49	@jonathanwallace	no notifications are not working
2012-12-13 12:09:51	@barbecuesteve	haha. :)
2012-12-13 12:09:54	@jonathanwallace	time to debug python i guess
2012-12-13 12:10:02	@rainbow-zsh	Don't do it. it's a trap!
2012-12-13 12:10:45	@barbecuesteve	rainbow-zsh: it's not exactly the criteria, but it's informed… you gotta be a pretty great restaurant to earn an 'excellent' from me… i'd give it to two in KC, two in TX, and one in AL.
2012-12-13 12:11:38	@barbecuesteve	I'm sure there are more, and of course, it's all in the eye of the beholder.
2012-12-13 12:12:02	@barbecuesteve	kurtisnelson: the basic metric is "how far am I willing to drive for no other purpose than to grab that BBQ and drive home."
2012-12-13 12:12:15	@barbecuesteve	If it's 3 hours or more, it's an excellent restaurant.
2012-12-13 12:12:28	@barbecuesteve	actually, i'd say 90 minutes.
2012-12-13 12:12:32	@barbecuesteve	3 hours trip total.
2012-12-13 12:12:44	@barbecuesteve	If you're willing to drive 90 minutes for a meal, that's gotta be a great meal.

2012-12-13 15:54:18	@imtzo	What shell can I switch to that does not do stupid things when I type:   echo "Howdy!"
2012-12-13 15:58:04	@lyricsboy	boy bash sure isn't it
2012-12-13 15:58:20	@lyricsboy	i guess you could use single quotes
2012-12-13 15:58:38	@lyricsboy	it is not the spoon that bends, but your mind
2012-12-13 16:01:09	@imtzo	Thanks, lyricsboy. I could be saving a whole modifier key AND get the behavior I want!
2012-12-13 16:01:35	@imtzo	I prefer this though:  echo "Howdy"'!'
2012-12-13 16:01:39	@lyricsboy	hahaha
2012-12-13 16:02:15	@imtzo	On superuser.com they say that you can turn off history expansion: "set +H"  But that seems like an unpleasant solution.
2012-12-13 16:02:29	@lyricsboy	i've always kind of liked the differentiation of double and single quotes
2012-12-13 16:02:42	@lyricsboy	single quotes is like I MEAN IT OK
2012-12-13 16:03:06	@billjings	imtzo: first step is not to use double quotes
2012-12-13 16:03:07	@imtzo	Speak softly, carry a big stick?
2012-12-13 16:03:13	@billjings	double quotes = the devil
2012-12-13 16:03:19	@billjings	only use when you want to escape a variable
2012-12-13 16:03:23	@billjings	single quotes ftw
2012-12-13 16:03:26	@imtzo	DQ = the devil. Got it.
2012-12-13 16:04:00	@billjings	i guess they're not REALLY the devil. but you should only use them when you want shell magic inside the thing you're quoting.
2012-12-13 16:04:21	@imtzo	Sound advice.
2012-12-13 16:05:22	@billjings	just realized that i basically came into the conversation saying the same thing as lyricsboy, only louder and more opinionated
2012-12-13 16:06:01	@imtzo	Facebook has trained you well.
2012-12-13 16:07:29	@natechan	is it easy to look at blame prior to a specific commit on github?
2012-12-13 16:08:34	@natechan	i'd even take possible
2012-12-13 16:08:41	@kurtisnelson	why dodn't you use zsh?
2012-12-13 16:09:43	@lyricsboy	natechan: does github have a blame feature at all?

2012-12-14 14:47:30	@lyricsboy	so now there's a hole in the front of the thing
2012-12-14 14:47:45	@lyricsboy	i could try putting the part on from the old screen, but it'd require a complete redo

2012-12-14 15:11:38	@rainbow-zsh	It's got some good stuff.
2012-12-14 15:12:03	@rainbow-zsh	The EINTR thing is a standard POSIX gotcha that long predates OS X and Obj-C. :)

2012-12-17 11:22:06	@rickstrict	can someone double check this block def? I can never remember the syntax proper
2012-12-17 11:22:06	@rickstrict	(^ completion)(UMMRAGetEnhancedShowDetailsResult *obj, NSError *err) = ^(UMMRAGetEnhancedShowDetailsResult *obj, NSError *err) {
2012-12-17 11:23:23	@rickstrict	ping mikeyward rainbow-zsh
2012-12-17 11:23:35	@randomstep	returning void?
2012-12-17 11:23:48	@rickstrict	no it should be returning the obj
2012-12-17 11:23:59	@rickstrict	or rather. using the obj inside the block
2012-12-17 11:24:46	@rickstrict	I'm trying to abstract from the completion block of a web service call
2012-12-17 11:24:46	@mikeyward	what'd I do?
2012-12-17 11:24:49	@rickstrict	halps
2012-12-17 11:25:27	@mikeyward	the declaration side of the assignment needs to have the return type iirc
2012-12-17 11:25:59	@rickstrict	so void? is it returning void? i feel its not
2012-12-17 11:26:07	@rickstrict	its returning an obj and err right?
2012-12-17 11:26:20	@randomstep	no, it's passing those into the block.
2012-12-17 11:26:25	@rickstrict	oh
2012-12-17 11:26:35	@rickstrict	I'm obviously bad at blocks
2012-12-17 11:26:47	@randomstep	yeah, I find them tricky too.
2012-12-17 11:27:01	@randomstep	lesseee
2012-12-17 11:27:22	@randomstep	void (^ completion)(UMMRAGetEnhancedShowDetailsResult *, NSError *) = ^(UMMRAGetEnhancedShowDetailsResult *obj, NSError *err) {
2012-12-17 11:27:27	@randomstep	dang that's a long class name
2012-12-17 11:27:33	@rickstrict	we have better
2012-12-17 11:27:39	 *	randomstep cowers
2012-12-17 11:27:39	@rickstrict	do not worry
2012-12-17 11:28:13	@randomstep	you don't have to put names for the pointers on the left side, but I prefer to do it (same as you did)
2012-12-17 11:28:26	@randomstep	so yeah, just declare the return type
2012-12-17 11:28:30	@rickstrict	what you mean?
2012-12-17 11:28:42	@rickstrict	how would i pass the block if i don't give it a name?
2012-12-17 11:28:59	@randomstep	not the block name, the args being passed in.
2012-12-17 11:29:19	@randomstep	When you're defining the block you have to provide names for the pointer, but not when you're declaring it.
2012-12-17 11:29:22	@rickstrict	ooh
2012-12-17 11:29:24	@randomstep	(left side of the assignment operator)

2012-12-17 11:29:34	@randomstep	but I like to do it anyway, for greater clarity.
2012-12-17 11:29:35	@rickstrict	gotit
2012-12-17 11:29:40	@rickstrict	yeah i agree
2012-12-17 11:29:57	@randomstep	Also you don't have to declare separately if you're just using in one place.
2012-12-17 11:30:07	@rickstrict	no i am
2012-12-17 11:30:18	@rickstrict	thats why i need to abstract it and declare it
2012-12-17 11:30:24	@randomstep	ah, ok.
2012-12-17 11:30:28	@rickstrict	so i can use it in two places in an if statement
2012-12-17 11:30:50	@rickstrict	so all i was missing was the void
2012-12-17 11:30:51	@rickstrict	?
2012-12-17 11:30:56	@randomstep	I'd maybe say "completionBlock" as the name, too, but that's just a nit.
2012-12-17 11:31:04	@rickstrict	ah
2012-12-17 11:31:07	@randomstep	yep, I think so.
2012-12-17 11:32:05	@randomstep	ping me if you're still having issues.
2012-12-17 11:32:26	@rickstrict	well the compilers happy, so maybe it'll work
2012-12-17 11:32:42	@randomstep	:)
2012-12-17 11:33:16	@randomstep	it's like a c function definition, so requires the return type.
2012-12-17 11:33:34	@randomstep	but at the current moment I trust the compiler about as far as I can throw it. :P

2012-12-18 14:00:12	@randomstep	Haha, my abs are so weak. I just did some standard ab exercises. Situps, leg lifts, planks, pulsing.
2012-12-18 14:00:49	@randomstep	But I'd pretty much taken the year off for workouts (other than a bit of running and swimming here and there), so pretty much anything feels great right now.
2012-12-18 14:01:29	@randomstep	plus I like having a workout plan. Which in this case, is "do what she says and no one gets hurt. Too much."

2012-12-18 15:40:22	@randomstep	ok, so implementing isEqual:, I also need to implement hash.
2012-12-18 15:40:27	@randomstep	So …  - (NSUInteger)hash
2012-12-18 15:40:27	@randomstep	{

2012-12-18 15:41:02	@randomstep	ok to just add the hashes? Or is that incredibly naïve?
2012-12-18 15:41:17	@wildCowboy	I just did something like that. Brian H. pointed me to something better.

2012-12-18 15:45:35	@billjings	it would be nice if there were an equivalent to creating a tuple in python, or an ArrayList of Objects in Java (which I think generates a hash code dependent on its contents)
2012-12-18 15:45:59	@wildCowboy	In the article, he does say you can just shove it in to an NSData object if you want
2012-12-18 15:46:51	@billjings	not the same thing - if you do a python tuple, the tuple's hash is a sensibly generated combination of each object's hash
2012-12-18 15:47:00	@billjings	which it doesn't look like NSData does

2012-12-21 14:56:59	@pturner	I have two view controllers, the first is limited to landscape left/right only
2012-12-21 14:57:14	@pturner	the one that gets popped on top can rotate everywhere
2012-12-21 14:57:22	@rickstrict	what do you want it to do?
2012-12-21 14:57:44	@pturner	on going back I don't want the first to be in portrait if the second happened to be in portrait before it left
2012-12-21 14:57:58	@pturner	aka auto rotate to landscape upon going back
2012-12-21 15:00:12	@rickstrict	why would you have a pushed view that rotates more than the parent?
2012-12-21 15:02:59	@natechan	what version of iOS are you targetting?
2012-12-21 15:03:38	@pturner	4.2 it seems (inherited project from client)
2012-12-21 15:04:36	@markd2	my cycling fusion app does kind of like that - mostly it's portrait for editing and interaction, but when running the cycling class ,the instructor's dashboard can be landscape or portrait
2012-12-21 15:05:51	@pturner	rickstrict: the first view is a keyboard of sorts and the second is a help page so they are free to rotate around
2012-12-21 15:06:01	@rickstrict	ah okay
2012-12-21 15:06:34	@pturner	I could restrict the second to landscape only but was only going to do so if I failed miserably here

2013-01-02 12:47:55	@natechan	do there exist difficulties in sending via USPS to 1989 College Ave?
2013-01-02 12:50:27	@mikeyward	Yeah
2013-01-02 12:50:30	@lyricsboy	after my lunch break buying $0.32 stamps from a kiosk that would only sell me 6 at a time, i feel like there exist difficulties in everything the usps does
2013-01-02 12:50:58	@mikeyward	Services that do a USPS lookup for our company resolve it as 1985 College Ave, not 1989
2013-01-02 12:51:01	@markd2	doesn't everyone keep $1.92 on-hand?
2013-01-02 12:54:02	@lyricsboy	i was at least able to use a credit card, but i had to make 10 separate 6-stamp "purchases" in one session
2013-01-02 12:54:47	@lyricsboy	a helpful friendly postal worker showed me how to use the kiosk, and i didn't have the heart to question the 6-stamp limit
2013-01-02 12:54:49	@markd2	the usps is going bankrupt just from creditcard fees

2013-01-03 08:32:49	@rickstrict	figured i would check before i got Viscosity
2013-01-03 08:33:55	@alindeman	HAHA
2013-01-03 08:34:16	@alindeman	HG has its own VPN, I don't think we have a persistent connection b/w HG and GHQ, though that would be fun
2013-01-03 08:34:36	@alindeman	s/fun/nice to have/
2013-01-03 08:34:48	@markd2	does the built-in vpn client not work for that?
2013-01-03 08:34:48	@ejenkins	shouldn't be too hard to set up if we decide we wanted it
2013-01-03 08:35:53	@ejenkins	well, a permanent IPsec tunnel would be nice, to not have to be VPNed in all the time
2013-01-03 08:35:56	@rickstrict	well i figured it would maybe make sense to have one so that both offices would be connected, and save on VPN expenses
2013-01-03 08:36:22	@lyricsboy	we could set up some kind of point to point thing
2013-01-03 08:36:41	@lyricsboy	it has been discussed
2013-01-03 08:36:50	@ejenkins	IPsec would be the way tog o

2013-01-03 08:38:01	@alindeman	If we could transparently address one another's internal IPs, that'd make stuff like pairing easier too
2013-01-03 08:38:45	@ejenkins	that would be the goal of said tunnel - what is the USSHG subnet?
2013-01-03 08:39:04	@alindeman	inet 172.18.1.100 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 172.18.1.255
2013-01-03 08:39:41	@ejenkins	true, we are 10.1.10.0/32
2013-01-03 08:39:46	@ejenkins	so there wouldn't be any conflicts
2013-01-03 08:39:53	@alindeman	Sweet
2013-01-03 08:40:22	@lyricsboy	we'd need some way to make internal dns work nicely
2013-01-03 08:40:30	@lyricsboy	for both camps
2013-01-03 08:40:58	@lyricsboy	i guess each endpoint of the vpn could have the other's dns server in their list
2013-01-03 08:41:01	@lyricsboy	for dhcp
2013-01-03 08:41:09	@ejenkins	we could just add each others routers IP as a DNS server
2013-01-03 08:41:11	@ejenkins	at each end

2013-01-03 10:34:34	@greggroth	auto-op?
2013-01-03 10:35:21	@mikeyward	op == operator - gives you admin privileges in the channel, like the ability to kick, ban other people.

2013-01-14 15:15:44	@rickstrict	i think you mean 'wave detecting buoy'
2013-01-14 15:15:50	@rickstrict	not an alert
2013-01-14 15:16:31	@alindeman	HAHA, yes
2013-01-14 15:16:33	@alindeman	Sorry
2013-01-14 15:17:05	@alindeman	Could IRC also serve as a renewable energy source?
2013-01-14 15:17:42	@rickstrict	if there are enough ships, perhaps
2013-01-14 15:18:14	@rickstrict	and the ships are also using renewable engergy, like wind
2013-01-14 15:41:44	@billjings	so do people regularly complain about the utility of the iOS slides like they do for the android course? :/
2013-01-14 15:45:49	@billjings	i am probably going to hit the slides with a hammer after the book is done
2013-01-14 15:46:19	@rickstrict	what do you  mean?
2013-01-14 15:46:26	@rickstrict	what are there common complaints?
2013-01-14 15:46:41	@billjings	just that they're not that useful, and that people only ever read the manual
2013-01-14 15:46:51	@rickstrict	hmm
2013-01-14 15:47:02	@billjings	part of the problem is that i do not really like leaning on slides that much
2013-01-14 15:47:06	@rickstrict	well the slides arent meant to contain all the info, its more about you talking about it
2013-01-14 15:47:13	@billjings	right
2013-01-14 15:47:19	@rickstrict	i feel youre doing it the right way
2013-01-14 15:47:27	@billjings	still
2013-01-14 15:47:28	@pturner	Eh I think the people that like them are people that take notes with the lecture
2013-01-14 15:47:29	@rickstrict	would they rather the slides be full of text?
2013-01-14 15:47:33	@billjings	students complain, and it bugs me
2013-01-14 15:47:39	@pturner	which isn't many students
2013-01-14 15:47:52	@billjings	pturner: that's what I generally say. "Use the slides book to follow along and take notes"
2013-01-14 15:49:33	@pturner	hmm I rather they be inconvenienced by the slides book
2013-01-14 15:49:34	@ejenkins	billjings: I wouldn't let FB students dictate your opinion as to the quality of materials
2013-01-14 15:49:44	@pturner	than for someone that likes to take notes not have the option to
2013-01-14 15:50:09	@pturner	i mean you can take notes on a piece of paper but it's nice to have a reference to what you write
2013-01-14 15:50:14	@pturner	dunno if that makes sense
2013-01-14 15:50:16	@ejenkins	it seems like a lot of them, want everything you are going to say condensed and put into slide form, so they can just go read it themselves
2013-01-14 15:50:42	@billjings	which is basically what the book is
2013-01-14 15:50:45	@ejenkins	which a lot of FBers can certainly do, but they are the top end of anybody we teach
2013-01-14 15:51:11	@ejenkins	yeah, but they don't want to read the book
2013-01-14 15:51:17	@ejenkins	when they have the much thinner slide book
2013-01-14 15:51:38	@ejenkins	but the slides don't have all the content!
2013-01-14 15:51:43	@ejenkins	and now we've come full circle
2013-01-14 15:51:48	@billjings	FB actually has a decent mix of folks

2013-01-14 17:08:40	@barbecuesteve	billjings: small use case.
2013-01-14 17:08:56	@barbecuesteve	But my friend at Teh Googleplex asked me about thousands of 'em.
2013-01-14 17:09:01	@barbecuesteve	Maybe that'll pan out.
2013-01-14 17:09:10	@billjings	small? it's, like, everyone who has a heterogeneous mac environment
2013-01-14 17:09:20	@barbecuesteve	ah, but with dual-use power supplies
2013-01-14 17:09:27	@billjings	i wonder who you might talk to over here
2013-01-14 17:09:53	@billjings	the use case is basically everyone who bought the apple magsafe 2 adapter
2013-01-14 17:10:19	@barbecuesteve	No, not quite.
2013-01-14 17:10:34	@barbecuesteve	Anyone who bought that adapter for use on a power brick that gets used by both types of computers.
2013-01-14 17:10:49	@barbecuesteve	If it's for their solo computer, upgraded, the adapter will stay on the brick and never come off and never get lost.
2013-01-14 17:11:13	@barbecuesteve	So in my house we have one on the dining room table, and one on the workstation.
2013-01-14 17:11:22	@barbecuesteve	Makes sense in office conference rooms or isolation cubbies.
2013-01-14 17:11:41	@billjings	ahh, k
2013-01-14 17:11:57	@billjings	so people who no longer have magsafe 1 computers will not need them
2013-01-14 17:12:04	@barbecuesteve	correct.

2013-01-14 17:12:32	@rickstrict	i agree with bill
2013-01-14 17:12:43	@barbecuesteve	How big, though? 100,000 units?
2013-01-14 17:13:08	@billjings	like, apple could have just integrated that into the adapter in the first place and people would've been happy
2013-01-14 17:13:52	@billjings	my naive spitball is, if you were to reach everyone who would actually use it, 1/2 of total adapter sales.
2013-01-14 17:14:28	@barbecuesteve	gee, well, that helps. :D
2013-01-14 17:14:38	@billjings	you might want to sell them in a 3 pack, since they're cheap to manufacture, and onesies might be a tough sell

2013-01-15 12:53:41	@rainbow-zsh	You have to clicky to get it to display the full email address.

2013-01-15 14:28:53	@rickstrict	is there any catch going from long to double?
2013-01-15 14:28:57	@rickstrict	i cant remember..
2013-01-15 14:29:11	@markd2	well, one's an int and the other's a float
2013-01-15 14:29:12	@rickstrict	technically time_t to NSTimeInterval, but subtypes are long and double
2013-01-15 14:29:25	@markd2	nah, that should be fine
2013-01-15 14:30:02	@rickstrict	okay thanks
2013-01-15 14:36:30	@rickstrict	this is safe right?
2013-01-15 14:36:30	@rickstrict	NSTimeInterval secondsUntilEndOfShow(time_t endTime) {
2013-01-15 14:36:32	@rickstrict	    time_t currentTime = [[NSDate date] timeIntervalSince1970];
2013-01-15 14:36:32	@rickstrict	    return abs(currentTime - endTime) / 60.0f;
2013-01-15 14:36:42	@rickstrict	double( long / float)
2013-01-15 14:36:55	@rickstrict	(double)( long / float)
2013-01-15 14:37:02	@rickstrict	i just wanted to use all the types
2013-01-15 14:37:16	@markd2	I'd make currentTime an NSTimeInterval, since that's what you'll be getting back from that and it's your return type
2013-01-15 14:37:44	@rickstrict	oh youre right, i thought it returned  time_t
2013-01-15 14:38:21	@rickstrict	thanks
2013-01-15 14:38:25	@markd2	cocoa?  returning a _t type?  :-)
2013-01-15 14:38:41	@rickstrict	ha i guess not
2013-01-15 14:40:17	@rickstrict	silly me

2013-01-15 15:15:39	@billjings	it's JUST the swordfighting from monkey island!

2013-01-15 15:15:48	@billjings	goodbye afternoon
2013-01-15 15:17:29	@randomstep	heh. I'm refusing to open that. Instapaper'd
2013-01-15 15:18:23	@imtzo	billjings: I tried that out yesterday and was a little puzzled. Is it a reimplementation of a subset of the MI games?  Never got very far in MI, sadly.
2013-01-15 15:18:53	@imtzo	I did enjoy the campfire discussion (the one animated on that site, that is).
2013-01-15 15:19:27	@billjings	It's a minigame in MI1 (and MI3?)
2013-01-15 15:19:50	@billjings	you swordfight by insulting people, or responding with witty ripostes
2013-01-15 15:20:15	@imtzo	Ok. Very sensible.
2013-01-15 15:20:40	@billjings	it's not a very hard game, honestly - basically, you use insults you don't have a riposte for yet
2013-01-15 15:20:48	@billjings	and fight folks trying to discover more insults
2013-01-15 15:20:52	@billjings	most of the fun is in reading the goofy insults
2013-01-15 15:23:12	@imtzo	I am very fond of those games despite my inability to play without a guide.

2013-01-16 16:17:41	@mccgeek	I fear for the safety of the people of Atlanta now that you guys can write software that actually makes physical things. I'm glad I'm 750 miles to the north.  ;)
2013-01-16 16:18:10	@mccgeek	I expect to hear reports of giant robots marauding through downtown
2013-01-16 16:18:14	@mccgeek	Atlanta by morning.
2013-01-16 16:19:08	@imtzo	We only have so much material, thankfully. Although I suppose it's only a matter of time until it is able to extrude the building and its foundation into something larger.
2013-01-16 16:20:39	@mccgeek	OK, a bunch of really tiny robots, then.  Although I'm not sure you can call what tiny robots do as marauding.
2013-01-16 16:22:08	@jonathanwallace	borging?
2013-01-16 16:27:00	@barbecuesteve	what's printing?
2013-01-16 16:28:37	@jonathanwallace	we need to hook bnrbot and nerdbot up to such things

2013-01-17 11:28:30	@markd2	greetings!
2013-01-17 11:29:10	griotspeak	I have a question that you can probably answer
2013-01-17 11:29:18	griotspeak	what I am doing to get the linker error "ld: library not found for -lelf" and how to fix it?
2013-01-17 11:31:53	@markd2	do you have an "-lelf" command on the link line?
2013-01-17 11:32:09	@markd2	if so, you'll need to have a libelf.a or libelf.dylib in the linker search path
2013-01-17 11:32:50	griotspeak	alright, I will digest that and return.
2013-01-17 11:33:28	griotspeak	(I am getting this in xcode and "-lelf" is nowhere in my build settings)
2013-01-17 11:33:36	@jonathanwallace	markd2: does Xcode use LD_PATH?
2013-01-17 11:34:00	 *	jonathanwallace is curious and very ignorant of Xcode things
2013-01-17 11:34:12	@markd2	Xcode is a festering pile
2013-01-17 11:34:19	@markd2	er, did I say that out loud
2013-01-17 11:34:28	@markd2	I think it does.  You may need to tweak the build setting if it exists
2013-01-17 11:34:51	@jonathanwallace	werd
2013-01-17 11:35:11	@markd2	you can add stuff to "other linker flags"
2013-01-17 11:35:55	@jonathanwallace	yeah, i've done that before when using a OS lib once
2013-01-17 11:37:35	@jonathanwallace	OS == open source
2013-01-17 11:44:48	@rainbow-zsh	griotspeak: The final word on what's in your build settings is what you see in the full compiler invocation in the build log.
2013-01-17 11:44:58	@rainbow-zsh	You can copy-paste all and then grep/drop in vim and search.
2013-01-17 11:45:20	griotspeak	yeah, that "-lelf" was in the invocation
2013-01-17 11:45:30	griotspeak	I just have no idea why
2013-01-17 11:45:55	@rainbow-zsh	There are about 3 ways I can think of to add a library to a project in Xcode, more if you count the project vs. target level thing.
2013-01-17 11:46:08	@rainbow-zsh	And you could probably come up with more ways if you worked at it. >_<
2013-01-17 11:46:24	@rainbow-zsh	Sometimes just editing project.pbxproj in an editor and searching for the text is the easiest way.
2013-01-17 11:46:36	griotspeak	i seem to have just found the place where i link it
2013-01-17 11:46:38	griotspeak	...
2013-01-17 11:46:40	@rainbow-zsh	You can find out where it's being set and then go back to Xcode to edit it.
2013-01-17 11:46:41	griotspeak	maybe a simple delete
2013-01-17 11:47:10	griotspeak	yay for a new error!

2013-01-17 13:26:17	griotspeak	(as though there was no break in between) Unfortunately ARC make some of that meta programming less usable. +resolveInstanceMethod is a pain with ARC
2013-01-17 13:27:10	@markd2	turn it off for that one file
2013-01-17 13:27:21	@markd2	-fno-objc-arc
2013-01-17 13:28:23	griotspeak	markd2 it is more an issue of the compiler now getting very fussy if it can't find the declaration of a method
2013-01-17 13:28:34	griotspeak	very fussy.
2013-01-17 13:28:40	@markd2	stick it into an NSObject category
2013-01-17 13:29:50	griotspeak	i shied away from that, but sure. (the other problem is that I wanted a ruby-eque ability to accept any string and figure out the note name…allowing for INFINITE ACCIDENTALS)
2013-01-17 13:30:08	griotspeak	i attained that with initWithString
2013-01-17 13:30:23	@markd2	note name?
2013-01-17 13:30:32	griotspeak	I wanted the [TJUPitchClass C############]
2013-01-17 13:30:36	griotspeak	to work
2013-01-17 13:30:56	griotspeak	without declaring all possible accidentals
2013-01-17 13:31:02	 *	markd2 is completely lost
2013-01-17 13:31:37	griotspeak	I have a class named TJUMTPitchClass that represents pitch classes. like. C or C♯ or c 𝄫
2013-01-17 13:31:55	@markd2	whoa.  TJ, as in *the* TJ?
2013-01-17 13:32:03	griotspeak	yuppers

2013-01-17 13:32:21	griotspeak	Many thanks!
2013-01-17 13:32:27	@markd2	you still in boston, or down in ATL?
2013-01-17 13:32:30	griotspeak	ATL
2013-01-17 13:32:37	griotspeak	*blushes*
2013-01-17 13:32:43	@markd2	gonna be around awhile?  I'll be in town end of february
2013-01-17 13:33:08	griotspeak	yup, at least through march, but it is looking like I will stay and put away school for now
2013-01-17 13:33:15	griotspeak	ie no grad school
2013-01-17 13:36:05	@rainbow-zsh	griotspeak: Instead of adding a method, handle it in the equivalent of method_missing?

2013-01-17 13:36:31	@rainbow-zsh	forwardMessage: or whatever. Been a while since I had to mess with that.
2013-01-17 13:36:46	griotspeak	that would be resolveInstanceClass but i still end up having to declare for the compiler to calm down
2013-01-17 13:37:06	griotspeak	I actually have the implementation, but don't do anything with it
2013-01-17 13:37:21	griotspeak	because i would need to add a category declaring all of the class methods
2013-01-17 13:37:29	@rainbow-zsh	I guess I wasn't sure what you wanted to return from that message to TJUPitchClass.
2013-01-17 13:37:50	@rainbow-zsh	If it's just returning a Note class or sth with data inside based on the message, you don't really need a new class.
2013-01-17 13:38:05	griotspeak	the same thing as if you send it [TJUPitchClass pitchClassFromString:@"C###############"] which works
2013-01-17 13:38:30	griotspeak	ah, sorry, resolveClassMethod
2013-01-17 13:38:43	griotspeak	it should return an instance of TJUPitchClass
2013-01-17 13:39:31	griotspeak	I am told that that is very ruby like behavior and that the more cocoa like behavior is +pitchClassFromString:
2013-01-17 13:39:46	griotspeak	so, I moved on, but can never truly forgive. :p
2013-01-17 13:41:26	@markd2	I think I'd rather have the warning about unknown methods :-)
2013-01-17 13:41:33	griotspeak	yeah
2013-01-17 13:41:42	griotspeak	i definitely get that
2013-01-17 13:44:15	@rainbow-zsh	griotspeak: I'm saying skip that and handle methodSignatureForSelector: and forwardInvocation: instead. That's the last step before doesNotRecognizeSelector:, which might be an even easier point to hook.
2013-01-17 13:45:05	griotspeak	but no one can call it in code that they have written without compiler issues. they would have to do it dynamically and at that point, a string does just as well
2013-01-17 13:45:09	@rainbow-zsh	Ah, darn, that doesn't work, because at that point it doesn't return the value.
2013-01-17 13:45:39	@rainbow-zsh	Hmm. A shame.
2013-01-17 13:45:50	@rainbow-zsh	Another ARC victim. :(
2013-01-17 13:45:55	griotspeak	indeed
2013-01-17 13:46:07	griotspeak	I agree that the pros outweigh the cons in many senses
2013-01-17 13:46:17	griotspeak	but i COULD have done it
2013-01-17 13:46:21	griotspeak	heh
2013-01-17 13:47:47	@rainbow-zsh	Now I appreciate more how ARC is strait-jacketing Obj-C code into Cocoa-land. :\

2013-01-17 13:51:42	griotspeak	such is the fate of dynamic minds world of ever increasing static typed-ness
2013-01-17 13:53:07	@rainbow-zsh	The problem is the type system doesn't let you declare a type for a regex of methods.
2013-01-17 13:55:16	griotspeak	i kept that thought to myself. it seems that I didn't have to
2013-01-17 13:55:35	griotspeak	solving things with regex is a uniquely developer habit

2013-01-23 08:33:52	@randomstep	I'm not seeing where they're documented in any of the header files for SenTest kit.
2013-01-23 08:34:02	@randomstep	Or, anywhere. Besides a stack overflow post.
2013-01-23 08:34:19	@randomstep	rainbow-zsh ^
2013-01-23 08:34:38	@rainbow-zsh	I thought they were maybe setUp and tearDown.
2013-01-23 08:34:57	@rainbow-zsh	What's OCUnit, btw? I thought we used SenTest?
2013-01-23 08:35:38	@randomstep	sorry, it is setUp and tear down.
2013-01-23 08:36:09	@randomstep	I think OCUnit is the name of the open-source version before Apple acquired it and the guy who wrote it.
2013-01-23 08:36:16	@randomstep	I should verify that.
2013-01-23 08:36:19	@rainbow-zsh	SenTest was the open-source version. :)
2013-01-23 08:36:20	@randomstep	Argh. tearDown
2013-01-23 08:36:27	@rainbow-zsh	I used it before Apple took it over.
2013-01-23 08:36:27	@randomstep	Oh. Hmm.
2013-01-23 08:36:31	@rainbow-zsh	From sente.ch IIRC.
2013-01-23 08:36:49	@randomstep	I guess I will find out. Apple's docs on it are horrid.
2013-01-23 08:36:55	@rainbow-zsh	Hmm, maybe they did call it OCUnit.
2013-01-23 08:36:57	@rickstrict	ejenkins knows a bit about it i think
2013-01-23 08:36:59	@rainbow-zsh	And I just thought of it as the other thing.

2013-01-23 08:38:30	@randomstep	hmm. Doing empirical testing now, but wish I could find some reference. It would have to be in the header, unless it's a category or something?
2013-01-23 08:38:54	@randomstep	hmm, breakpoint never gets hit. Maybe stack overflow is just lying.
2013-01-23 08:38:55	@rainbow-zsh	If it's in a category on NSObject as -setUp, you can call all the NSObject methods on classes, too, so.

2013-01-23 08:41:50	@rainbow-zsh	randomstep: That's what I'm saying. You can call any -[NSObject blah] as if it were +[NSObject blah].

2013-01-23 08:42:29	@rainbow-zsh	Because once Apple adopts it, it's no longer cool.
2013-01-23 08:42:41	@rainbow-zsh	Or because Apple sucks at actually maintaining anything they get in their iron fist.
2013-01-23 08:42:49	@randomstep	Or at least not very hackable. Which is rather important for a test framework.
2013-01-23 08:42:54	@randomstep	yeah.

2013-01-23 14:06:19	randomstep1	student question (iOS): Java uses dependency injection to get at shared resources. Singletons are used a lot in iOS it seems. What other tools/ways to do this are there in iOS?
2013-01-23 14:06:30	randomstep1	Blanking on a good short answer for some reason.
2013-01-23 14:07:30	@markd2	that's the standard pattern, returning a shared thingie
2013-01-23 14:07:42	@markd2	or a class method that vends something, like +[UIScreen screens]
2013-01-23 14:08:17	randomstep1	ah
2013-01-23 14:08:30	randomstep1	that's what I was trying to think of, I think.
2013-01-23 14:08:44	@markd2	shared instances are just a specialization of the clas method vending
2013-01-23 14:09:06	@markd2	enforced singletons (like in the old days of hacking -alloc / init / retain) are pure evil, and should be avoid

2013-01-24 09:50:54	@natechan	xib conflicts are much trickier, and (to me at least) nearly impossible if two different branches have changes to the same xib
2013-01-24 09:50:59	@mikeyward	but natechan does it in his head and dares Xcode to defy him.
2013-01-24 09:51:09	@randomstep	:)
2013-01-24 09:51:25	@randomstep	yeah. .xib files are usually a loss.
2013-01-24 09:51:41	@randomstep	Fortunately the times I've run into that, one or the other set of changes was trivial, and easier to just redo.
2013-01-24 09:51:42	@rainbow-zsh	I try to keep long-running branches to a minimum, so you get at most a day out of sync with master.
2013-01-24 09:51:57	@natechan	i wasn't out of sync with master at all in this case (-:
2013-01-24 09:52:09	@rainbow-zsh	Then how did you get a conflict?
2013-01-24 09:52:18	@natechan	i was reverting a commit which involved a change to a xib which was not touched by another commit
2013-01-24 09:52:19	@mikeyward	I tend to use the English locking system to prevent conflicts. That is, I say, in English, "let me know /before/ you change the project so I can make sure I'm sync'd up."
2013-01-24 09:52:38	@randomstep	lol

2013-01-24 09:52:42	@rainbow-zsh	Huh, weird.
2013-01-24 09:52:52	@rainbow-zsh	mikeyward: I used to use svn lock when editing nib files.
2013-01-24 09:53:34	@natechan	woops...another commit after the one which was reverted changed two lines of the xib
2013-01-24 09:54:06	@rainbow-zsh	Yeah, I guess that could mess it up.
2013-01-24 09:56:50	@markd2	and, of course, xcode's random piddling on xib files when it decides to change the internal version or renumber all the ids, just for spite
2013-01-24 09:57:01	@natechan	and i think that's what happened here //-:
2013-01-24 09:57:14	@natechan	if i'd been more careful with that commit, though, i would have reset the changes to that file

2013-01-30 13:01:04	@randomstep	super is subtly but importantly different then the I had in my mental model. Pretty sure I've had to correct my mental model on this before.
2013-01-30 13:04:26	greggroth	ruby's super?
2013-01-30 13:07:13	@ejenkins	I'm assuming he means obj-c super

2013-01-30 13:57:45	@rainbow-zsh	imtzo: The "inferior" is debugger jargon for "the process being run under the debugger".
2013-01-30 13:58:50	@imtzo	Curious jargon indeed.
2013-01-30 14:00:41	@rainbow-zsh	randomstep: It's probably doing po NSStringFromCGRect(var)
2013-01-30 14:02:11	@rainbow-zsh	As far as running code in the process goes, I seem to remember some fun options as to whether threads other than the one you were currently inspecting were allowed to run when you ran code on your thread, or were held frozen. I think it was mentioned in the docs as a fun way to deadlock.

2013-01-30 14:23:37	@rainbow-zsh	I do sometimes feel like I need to sit down to really space out.
2013-01-30 14:27:52	@randomstep	yeah. On some problems even standing is too much of a distraction, and I can work through it better sitting down. I think that might ease with time though. Maybe.
2013-01-30 14:28:10	@rainbow-zsh	My solution has been to bounce around.

2013-01-30 14:32:21	@inuwali	Okay. I'm subclassing UIControl, creating a new one with initWithFrame: and putting it into a view.
2013-01-30 14:32:41	@inuwali	When I step into initWithFrame, the first line is of course [super initWithFrame].
2013-01-30 14:33:01	@inuwali	(self = [super initWithFrame:frame])
2013-01-30 14:33:06	@inuwali	I have a breakpoint there.
2013-01-30 14:33:24	@inuwali	I step over... And the program immediately continues, does not stop at the next line,
2013-01-30 14:33:54	@inuwali	It's as if the program just aborted the call at that point; no control, no window...

2013-01-31 17:00:04	@markd2	for great justice
2013-01-31 17:05:28	@rainbow-zsh	I haven't even looked at the new-fangled UI preservation stuff.
2013-01-31 17:05:48	@rainbow-zsh	I now Three20 framework was doing something based on representing navigation as URL accesses to internal pages at one time
2013-01-31 17:05:56	@rainbow-zsh	Made it easy to replay navigation steps on startup.
2013-01-31 17:07:02	@rainbow-zsh	*I know
2013-01-31 17:08:40	@imtzo	Three20's URL stuff was very curious indeed.
2013-01-31 17:10:39	@rainbow-zsh	I kind of like that idea.
2013-01-31 17:11:08	@rainbow-zsh	I have this feeling that a good chunk of iOS apps are just web apps with a different rendering and events system.
2013-01-31 17:11:57	@rainbow-zsh	And I will happily gripe about the Foundation URL loading system for a good 10 minutes if you let me. ;)
2013-01-31 17:13:00	@markd2	you should totally do a video series of API rant / reviews.
2013-01-31 17:13:42	@rainbow-zsh	Ranting is the easy part. I'd like to fix it instead. :)
2013-01-31 17:23:57	@billjings	Whatever you're good at is the easy part

2013-02-13 15:50:10	@markd2	about the only times I've had problems is when I write 30 pages of marked up Docbook in two days.
2013-02-13 15:50:16	@barbecuesteve	ejenkins: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5219?viewlocale=en_US#dispnum
2013-02-13 15:50:23	@barbecuesteve	it says it works with two thunderbolts
2013-02-13 15:50:32	@barbecuesteve	so maybe a thunderbolt and a 30" would work
2013-02-13 15:50:41	@barbecuesteve	that will be just sick.

2013-02-13 15:52:07	@barbecuesteve	I have this vision of working my way up to the Al Gore 3x30" setup. And on that day, seeing a picture of Al Gore with a 2x5x27" setup or something.
2013-02-13 15:55:38	@ejenkins	barbecuesteve: nice
2013-02-13 15:55:39	@ejenkins	doooo it
2013-02-13 15:56:22	@ejenkins	also
2013-02-13 15:56:36	@ejenkins	I want to know the technical reason for this "Note: The F8 key does not work when using Windows with a USB keyboard connected to an Apple Thunderbolt Display (27-inch)."
2013-02-13 15:56:43	@ejenkins	what a strange combination of factors
2013-02-13 16:00:20	@inuwali	I've been a home-rower since day 1. The wrist support thing, for me, is about having that flat area on the MacBook on either side of the trackpad.
2013-02-13 16:00:48	@inuwali	The way I rest my wrists there is little if any bend.
2013-02-13 16:01:27	@inuwali	I've never heard of Colemak. I thought about Dvorak for a while but it was so difficult to get started from zero
2013-02-13 16:03:24	@ejenkins	yeah, its unfortunate that most of us are stuck using a keyboard layout that was actually intended to slow typing speed
2013-02-13 16:03:38	@ejenkins	because the overhead of learning a new one is so high
2013-02-13 16:04:23	@barbecuesteve	haha
2013-02-13 16:05:04	@barbecuesteve	ejenkins: F8 must send some protected code. That's odd. What does it do?
2013-02-13 16:05:21	@barbecuesteve	I thought F8 booted in safe mode or something.
2013-02-13 16:05:26	@ejenkins	in windows?
2013-02-13 16:05:52	@ejenkins	it doesn't do anything special
2013-02-13 16:05:57	@ejenkins	maybe when booting
2013-02-13 16:06:03	@ejenkins	but I don't think so anymore
2013-02-13 16:06:06	@ejenkins	not with UEFI
2013-02-13 16:06:20	@ejenkins	there really isn't a protected mode anymore, even when booting
2013-02-13 16:07:30	@barbecuesteve	there are 1000 little black birds outside my house right now
2013-02-13 16:07:33	@barbecuesteve	sparrows?
2013-02-13 16:07:44	@ejenkins	hit F8
2013-02-13 16:09:12	@barbecuesteve	nope just the Mac "honk of fail"
2013-02-13 16:10:25	@ejenkins	haha
2013-02-13 16:11:15	@mikeyward	barbecuesteve I think that one's "sosumi"
2013-02-13 16:11:55	@barbecuesteve	nah, for me it's "Basso"
2013-02-13 16:12:06	@barbecuesteve	I still miss the Wild Eep.

2013-02-13 16:15:10	@mikeyward	barbecuesteve is Asterisk still one of 'em?
2013-02-13 16:15:23	@barbecuesteve	Sounds? No.
2013-02-13 16:16:21	@barbecuesteve	that IM ding that ejenkins and natechan love so much… think I might make it the Eep
2013-02-13 16:17:03	@ejenkins	barbecuesteve: for the record, I hate that ding
2013-02-13 16:17:28	@markd2	that ding *really* carries

2013-04-04 15:52:53	@inuwali	Hey guys, here's an interesting question for y'all
2013-04-04 15:53:26	@inuwali	I'm doing a very expensive Core Data query and splitting it up into batches on a BG thread
2013-04-04 15:53:44	@inuwali	Then syncing results into a NSMutableArray on the main thread to update the display
2013-04-04 15:54:02	@inuwali	Instruments shows that the BG thread occupies like 99% of the CPU, the main thread 1%
2013-04-04 15:54:32	@inuwali	Seems great, except that the UI stutters something horrible. I can't seem to figure out what's blocking the main thread using Instruments.

2013-04-04 16:00:56	@markd2	also turn on "record waiting threads" under the (i) flippy thing
2013-04-04 16:01:07	@markd2	not sure if that'll actually do it, but something to try :-)
2013-04-04 16:01:39	@inuwali	Yeah, I'm hitting "Separate by Thread" if that's what you mean
2013-04-04 16:01:56	@inuwali	Aha, "record waiting" may do it

2013-04-05 13:00:25	@rainbow-zsh	I only know of one person I follow on Twitter who regularly tweets via ADN.
2013-04-05 13:00:46	@rainbow-zsh	The service@username thing really eats chars in a tweet.
2013-04-05 13:01:06	@rainbow-zsh	twitter.com@foobar, app.net@plugh
2013-04-05 13:01:16	@mikeyward	Yeah, the 256 char limit is nice. And most folks don't abuse it.
2013-04-05 13:01:25	@mikeyward	But if you sign up, I suggest you unfollow me on twitter.
2013-04-05 13:01:32	@rainbow-zsh	Why, echoing both?
2013-04-05 13:01:46	@rainbow-zsh	I haven't seen too many tweets from you actually. I see a LOT of infosec tweets each day.
2013-04-05 13:01:55	@mikeyward	hahaha
2013-04-05 13:01:56	@rainbow-zsh	Those will scroll off almost anything in a hurry.
2013-04-05 13:01:58	@mikeyward	Well I try not to spam
2013-04-05 13:02:10	@rainbow-zsh	I mostly retweet or pullquote and link.
2013-04-05 13:02:28	@mikeyward	But if you see a tweet from me that's not a reply to someone, it originated via ADN. That's not necessarily true the other way around.
2013-04-05 13:03:00	@rainbow-zsh	ADN's extra chars would be useful for pullquotes, but RT only works if there's good content over at ADN to RT.
2013-04-05 13:03:14	@rainbow-zsh	I'm actually needing to throttle my Twittering time.
2013-04-05 13:03:33	@rainbow-zsh	I can space out and find far too much time has passed while I was "just checking Twitter" on my phone.
2013-04-05 13:03:45	@rainbow-zsh	Hitting the 8-tab limit in Safari is a good warning sign. :)

2013-04-05 13:41:31	@billjings	i now have a document in TextEdit that cannot be closed
2013-04-05 13:41:39	@rainbow-zsh	There's someone who understands their platform. Heh.
2013-04-05 13:41:40	@billjings	it does not exist and TextEdit wants to revert it
2013-04-05 13:42:06	@rainbow-zsh	I used to use TextEdit all the time, then Apple iClouded it and auto-saved it and it sucked.
2013-04-05 13:42:29	@rainbow-zsh	Now it tries to get me to create docs in iCloud all the time and won't let me readily create and discard documents.
2013-04-05 13:42:49	@rainbow-zsh	I used to use it as a temporary paste scratchpad when I had information I wanted to view in a GUI or just hold somewhere while I waited to paste it somewhere else.
2013-04-05 13:42:55	@rainbow-zsh	It's too high-friction for that now.
2013-04-05 13:44:14	@billjings	Well, all I know is that TextEdit can no longer be shut down
2013-04-05 13:44:23	@billjings	And neither can this window be closed.
2013-04-05 13:45:00	@rainbow-zsh	killall TextEdit
2013-04-05 13:46:00	@rainbow-zsh	Campfire web interface insists I'm no longer in srsbiz, but I'm still getting the messages via Campfire.
2013-04-05 13:46:05	@rainbow-zsh	I hate Campfire's backend.
2013-04-05 13:46:15	@rainbow-zsh	Err via camper_van for the later instance.

2013-04-05 13:46:36	@rainbow-zsh	Campfire's backend lets you be present in a room umpteen times, doesn't echo messages you send across logged-in terminals, etc.
2013-04-05 13:47:05	@rainbow-zsh	I wish we just all worked on a shared Unix machine and could just use wall, talk, etc.
2013-04-05 13:47:14	@rainbow-zsh	And local IRC within the machine.
2013-04-05 13:47:23	@rainbow-zsh	Cloud is the rebirth of timesharing.

2013-04-08 17:02:49	@imtzo	git: Anybody ever run into a situation with git where you inadvertently roll back changes you had previously made?  We are using a pull req workflow and I found that one of my commits somwhow magically included rolling back changes I had already made.
2013-04-08 17:03:50	@imtzo	Only weird thing I've done is that I tried to branch off of a feature branch for the subsequent work, submitting both as pull reqs, and that might have coincided with this.

2013-04-08 17:57:39	@randomstep	Yeah. It's always been really minor, small changes though. But I don't like it.
