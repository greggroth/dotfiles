2013-05-22 12:53:29	stevenharman	EC: I'm not sure. I think Andy originally wrote those, though perhaps the :find_broken_questions was only meant to be used to so we could make a decision on how to proceed with the Import?
2013-05-22 13:15:33	jonathanwallace	EC: not much, i think i could've used/modified Andy's code, Migration::Precheck::ValidatesQuizSteps when working on Migration::FindBrokenQuizSteps
2013-05-22 13:17:33	jonathanwallace	the biggest thing is that Migration::FindBrokenQuizSteps is used when running the migration to skip over importing specific questions that have issues

2013-06-10 12:47:44	@EC	No
2013-06-10 12:47:57	@EC	If it’s good and is highly desired I’ll integrate it into master
2013-06-10 12:48:10	@EC	And training can be rebased off master
2013-06-10 12:48:11	@EC	:)
2013-06-10 12:48:28	@EC	Although I suppose at the moment that’s effectively the same since I think this is the only thing in next-release

2013-06-17 10:14:57	laserlemon	sorry for the onslaught of jira emails this morning!
2013-06-17 10:15:34	greggroth	good morning!  no worries  ;-)
2013-06-17 10:17:04	greggroth	Am I allowed to merge 624?  I can't remember if I'm allowed to merge PRs into next-release.
2013-06-17 10:19:26	laserlemon	yes
2013-06-17 10:19:32	laserlemon	yes, *please*
2013-06-17 10:19:41	laserlemon	but wait
2013-06-17 10:19:49	laserlemon	don't merge the turkish one
2013-06-17 10:20:34	laserlemon	this is the only one that's ready for merge at the moment: https://code.apple.com/RetailSoftwareEngineering/intersect/pull/619
2013-06-17 10:21:01	laserlemon	for 624, we're still waiting on information from iWorld
2013-06-17 10:26:00	greggroth	ok.  I'll wait on 624.  I really wish there was a better way to make 619 happen, but I can't think of anything better than what you have.  :-/
2013-06-17 10:26:24	greggroth	I pinged Steven Harman to look it over to see if he has any ideas.
2013-06-17 10:29:47	laserlemon	ok thank you. i'd like to get that merged or get a new direction on it early today so we still have time to QA before the end of the iteration
2013-06-17 10:32:08	greggroth	ok.  If he doesn't get back in the next hour, I'll merge it.  Sound good?
2013-06-17 10:32:27	laserlemon	sounds good to me, thanks again
2013-06-17 10:53:02	greggroth	I may have found a query to do the job for 619.
2013-06-17 10:53:08	greggroth	I left a comment on the PR for you
2013-06-17 11:31:50	greggroth	laserlemon: I merged in 619 and left a note in the merge commit message to consider using mapreduce once next-release is using mongoid.
2013-06-17 11:33:49	laserlemon	sounds good
2013-06-17 11:33:55	laserlemon	thank you for the careful review!
2013-06-17 11:39:37	greggroth	np!  Sorry if it felt a bit too careful.  The whole reason we moved to mongo mapper was because of too many callbacks, so I'm very wary of adding more callbacks.

2013-06-17 14:35:37	greggroth	EC: I can't find your comments on github.  When I click the link in the e-mails they go the files section of my PR, but there aren't any comments visible.
2013-06-17 14:36:03	@EC	Yeah, I hate that feature of GitHub
2013-06-17 14:36:05	@EC	Not helpful
2013-06-17 14:36:17	@EC	I was commenting on your note about GridPosition
2013-06-17 14:36:55	greggroth	on Aubrey's PR?  I believe he updated the PR to use that model.
2013-06-17 14:37:22	greggroth	https://code.apple.com/RetailSoftwareEngineering/intersect/pull/623/files#L2R14
2013-06-17 14:37:24	greggroth	he did
2013-06-17 14:39:01	@EC	I may be blind
2013-06-17 14:39:13	@EC	I see GridSize but no GridPosition
2013-06-17 14:41:20	jonathanwallace	no, he changed how they were referenced but not to use GridPosition
2013-06-17 14:41:36	jonathanwallace	note, he was working on the mysql side, and GridPosition is a mongo thing
2013-06-17 14:41:52	jonathanwallace	IIRC
2013-06-17 14:42:32	laserlemon	jonathanwallace, greggroth: can i get a very quick code review in a minute?
2013-06-17 14:45:24	laserlemon	https://code.apple.com/RetailSoftwareEngineering/intersect/pull/626
2013-06-17 14:47:12	laserlemon	it's a patch to an already-pulled PR and they're trying to deploy by running this rake task
2013-06-17 14:52:07	jonathanwallace	does setting the id, link it up to the proper user?
2013-06-17 14:53:36	laserlemon	the "set" method accepts two arguments: query conditions and attributes to set
2013-06-17 14:54:03	laserlemon	so that method is saying set first_sunrise, last_sunset and updated_at for all creator files whose id is _____
2013-06-17 14:54:41	jonathanwallace	yep, gotcha. i'm trying to figure out how setting sunrise/sunset/updated_at fixes the current user issue?
2013-06-17 14:55:03	jonathanwallace	does it exclude files because they now have sunrise/sunset dates?
2013-06-17 14:55:07	laserlemon	the update happens at the database level, so we're never actually saving a ruby instance of the file document
2013-06-17 14:55:17	jonathanwallace	ah
2013-06-17 14:55:26	laserlemon	so no callbacks
2013-06-17 14:55:31	jonathanwallace	tricksy
2013-06-17 14:55:47	laserlemon	should be quite a bit faster, as a nice little side effect
2013-06-17 14:55:57	jonathanwallace	is there any value in still sending "set_publication_window" ?
2013-06-17 14:56:04	laserlemon	that's also why i'm setting updated_at, since ruby won't
2013-06-17 14:56:27	laserlemon	calling that method is how i'm getting the first_sunrise and last_sunset values to set
2013-06-17 14:56:36	jonathanwallace	ah
2013-06-17 14:59:45	greggroth	sorry I'm tardy to the party -- checking out that PR now
2013-06-17 14:59:55	jonathanwallace	haha "tardy to the party"
2013-06-17 15:00:30	jonathanwallace	i'm okay to merge it since i think we'll have to revisit when updating to mongoid?
2013-06-17 15:00:36	 *	jonathanwallace will defer to greggroth
2013-06-17 15:00:36	greggroth	jonathanwallace: does your wife make you watch Real Housewives of Atlanta also?
2013-06-17 15:00:44	jonathanwallace	no, thank god
2013-06-17 15:01:07	jonathanwallace	though, sometimes, when i'm staying in ATL at my friend's place, they have two shows set to record on DVR
2013-06-17 15:01:23	jonathanwallace	and the one playing on the TV is "Real Housewives of Atlanta" so i get stuck watching that or nothing at all :( :( :(
2013-06-17 15:01:59	greggroth	haha   yeah PR looks good to me.  I'll hit the button.

2013-06-19 12:47:26	@EC	laserlemon: FYI – interesting discovery last night
2013-06-19 12:47:39	laserlemon	good or bad?
2013-06-19 12:47:48	@EC	It looks like Intersect::Searchable was never intended to be used directly in our models
2013-06-19 12:47:56	@EC	It’s a Sunspot::Rails patch in disguise
2013-06-19 12:48:02	laserlemon	hmm
2013-06-19 12:48:04	@EC	(I’ll let you decide. :) )
2013-06-19 12:48:21	@EC	The module is loaded into Sunspot::Rails on config/initializers/sunspot
2013-06-19 12:48:26	laserlemon	oh yeah, i think i tracked that down
2013-06-19 12:48:26	@EC	*in
2013-06-19 12:48:47	laserlemon	oh, maybe didn't know that
2013-06-19 12:48:59	laserlemon	but knew we needed that in order to use sunspot queue
2013-06-19 12:49:04	@EC	Yep
2013-06-19 12:49:23	@EC	If you were working on an ActiveRecord model it would have magically been there
2013-06-19 12:49:30	@EC	Since it was Mongo, it wasn’t
2013-06-19 12:49:52	laserlemon	agh, right
2013-06-19 12:50:09	@EC	It’s kind of a mess
2013-06-19 12:50:11	laserlemon	weird that it's there for all AR models
2013-06-19 12:50:12	laserlemon	yeah
2013-06-19 12:50:26	laserlemon	any luck with your mongo exploration?
2013-06-19 12:50:31	laserlemon	re: sorting
2013-06-19 12:50:40	@EC	No. Had to abandon it.
2013-06-19 12:50:49	laserlemon	join the club
2013-06-19 12:51:01	@EC	But it looked like I wasn’t getting anywhere simpler than you guys were.
2013-06-19 12:51:35	laserlemon	mongo can do a lot of complicated things very simply
2013-06-19 12:51:36	@EC	I’ll take two memberships
2013-06-19 12:51:44	laserlemon	and a lot of simple stuff… not at all
2013-06-19 12:51:51	@EC	Yeah, I was really disappointed
2013-06-19 12:52:03	laserlemon	likewise
2013-06-19 12:52:31	@EC	I started to open a support ticket to ask about it or request a future enhancement. Didn’t get it finished.
2013-06-19 12:53:15	@EC	greggroth: Is this the week Jonathan is in India?
2013-06-19 12:53:24	@EC	Haven’t heard from him in a while
2013-06-19 12:53:56	@EC	Also, did you and Harmann get that check-out issue worked out?
2013-06-19 12:54:05	@EC	Old Harmann?
2013-06-19 13:08:54	greggroth	EC:  I believe he's on the plane now
2013-06-19 13:09:13	greggroth	not yet.
2013-06-19 13:18:17	greggroth	interesting -- When I run with app pointed at my development server, there isn't an additional GET request after I check out the document.  There's a PUT request to set it as checked out and that's it.
2013-06-19 13:18:32	greggroth	whereas on QA1 it did a second GET request.  I don't understand....
2013-06-19 13:26:47	@EC	I don’t either
2013-06-19 13:27:01	@EC	Seems like there could be a race condition client-side
2013-06-19 13:32:49	greggroth	That's all I can think of, although it's odd that it only happens for me.  :-(

2013-07-08 20:50:07	gaffneyc	Dear SCP, no one has ever wanted to copy a file to the name of a server. Ever.
2013-07-08 20:50:21	jonathanwallace	haha
2013-07-08 20:50:31	greggroth	gaffneyc++
2013-07-08 20:51:20	gaffneyc	Think another 10 minutes for mysql backup based on current file size
2013-07-08 20:52:28	@EC	k
2013-07-08 20:52:56	gaffneyc	Redis upgrade is prepped
2013-07-08 20:53:42	@EC	2.6?
2013-07-08 20:53:57	gaffneyc	I really don't see any reason not to
2013-07-08 20:54:03	gaffneyc	The API has been very stable
2013-07-08 20:54:14	gaffneyc	But I prepped 2.4.18
2013-07-08 20:54:23	@EC	Has it been on intersect-train or -qa?
2013-07-08 20:54:28	gaffneyc	No :/
2013-07-08 20:54:58	gaffneyc	Lets test 2.6 and roll out in a month?
2013-07-08 20:55:07	@EC	Yeah
2013-07-08 20:55:28	@EC	We need to go to MySQL 5.6 at some point
2013-07-08 20:55:32	@EC	Can do them together
2013-07-08 20:55:39	@EC	Along with replica sets
2013-07-08 20:55:41	@EC	Should make a nice downtime
2013-07-08 20:56:12	gaffneyc	Going to run out of FS space on db1-intersect-stage before the scp can finish
2013-07-08 20:56:16	gaffneyc	*backup
2013-07-08 20:56:46	@EC	Actually, not much to test with the charset change on -stage. It’s already at utf8.
2013-07-08 20:56:57	@EC	I’ll run it anyway (when ready)
2013-07-08 20:57:06	gaffneyc	34GB of backup took 15 minutes
2013-07-08 20:57:12	gaffneyc	So expect 30 minutes for mysql backup
2013-07-08 20:57:12	@EC	Not bad
2013-07-08 20:57:18	@EC	Oh right
2013-07-08 20:57:22	@EC	There’s 2
2013-07-08 20:57:30	gaffneyc	We'll do mysql and mongodb in parallel
2013-07-08 20:57:46	gaffneyc	And I may just do them from db3
2013-07-08 20:58:02	gaffneyc	We'll see how we're doing on time
2013-07-08 20:58:10	@EC	How confident are we db3 is perfect?
2013-07-08 20:58:41	gaffneyc	Mongo is replicating
2013-07-08 20:59:16	gaffneyc	How confident are we that db1 is a mysql slave of db2?
2013-07-08 20:59:27	@EC	85%
2013-07-08 20:59:33	gaffneyc	Hm
2013-07-08 20:59:48	@EC	It’s where I get production subsets from
2013-07-08 20:59:56	@EC	And those are usually up-to-date
2013-07-08 20:59:59	@EC	But not guaranteed
2013-07-08 21:00:03	@EC	Plus I skip some tables
2013-07-08 21:00:07	gaffneyc	We're depending on mysql and mongodb replication
2013-07-08 21:00:19	@EC	Let’s just do it from db2
2013-07-08 21:00:27	gaffneyc	Okay
2013-07-08 21:00:34	@EC	It’s our safety net
2013-07-08 21:00:37	gaffneyc	Trading time for confidence
2013-07-08 21:00:52	@EC	So we can be dangerous in other things 👿
2013-07-08 21:01:03	gaffneyc	hah, good way to put it
2013-07-08 21:01:05	@EC	T-60 mins til production
2013-07-08 21:01:18	gaffneyc	We can be down for 24 hours if we have to… as long as we don't lose data
2013-07-08 21:01:26	gaffneyc	*totally not jinxing this*
2013-07-08 21:01:27	@EC	Yep
2013-07-08 21:03:39	@EC	Verified Mongo is 2.2+ on db1-intersect-stage
2013-07-08 21:03:51	@EC	After charset will be ready to deploy
2013-07-08 21:04:04	@EC	Load balancer came back up
2013-07-08 21:04:23	gaffneyc	Load balancers should be 503 everything… hm...
2013-07-08 21:04:40	@EC	app1-intersect-stage is still down
2013-07-08 21:04:55	gaffneyc	Okay. Next chance I change everything to be chef-client service instead of cron
2013-07-08 21:05:42	gaffneyc	lb1 reverted / ran chef. lb2 was still good
2013-07-08 21:05:51	gaffneyc	With the new load balancers, only one will be active at a time
2013-07-08 21:06:02	@EC	Look at the beautiful Russian 503 page

2013-08-13 17:20:20	@EC	Some good news is that the client teams are being pulled away for those iOS and Mac projects
2013-08-13 17:20:28	@EC	So we don’t have to try and keep up with them for some time
2013-08-13 17:20:45	jonathanwallace	yeah, i was thinking that now's a good time to address some technical debt on our side if we can
2013-08-13 17:20:51	<--	laserlemon (~laserlemo@17.153.33.122) has quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
2013-08-13 17:20:51	@EC	We may actually have a couple months to solidify and refactor this thing to what we ant
2013-08-13 17:20:53	@EC	*want
2013-08-13 17:21:10	jonathanwallace	w00t!
2013-08-13 17:21:49	@EC	Back to books
2013-08-13 17:21:55	@EC	Does the concept make sense?
2013-08-13 17:22:04	@EC	What are your thoughts?
2013-08-13 17:22:32	pwnela	mind-blown.gif
2013-08-13 17:22:43	###	pwnela is now known as pamela
2013-08-13 17:23:00	@EC	So blown it scrambled the letters in your name
2013-08-13 17:23:02	jonathanwallace	yeah, it does make sense
2013-08-13 17:23:17	jonathanwallace	s/Compass/Library/g
2013-08-13 17:23:21	jonathanwallace	:D
2013-08-13 17:23:46	@EC	You could argue everything is part of the library
2013-08-13 17:23:58	@EC	But that’s a different discussino
2013-08-13 17:24:12	@EC	What changes come to mind that are needed?
2013-08-13 17:24:30	@EC	Not trying to lead you somewhere. You guys are a little ahead of me in getting to this.
2013-08-13 17:24:43	@EC	Just reviewed Compass for the first time in a long time yesterday.
2013-08-13 17:24:49	@EC	Sorted my thoughts this morning.
2013-08-13 17:25:39	jonathanwallace	i think the main change is renaming the Compass module to something that works with the Book metaphor
2013-08-13 17:26:09	jonathanwallace	i'm not sure of any implementation changes that should come about as i haven't really started to focus on compass until now
2013-08-13 17:26:37	@EC	Same here
2013-08-13 17:26:38	jonathanwallace	aubrey would know better
2013-08-13 17:27:02	@EC	There are some lower-level things that may need to change but I haven’t studied them close enough yet to know
2013-08-13 17:27:04	aubrey	yeah, I'm not sure anything would need to change besides just renaming the modules
2013-08-13 17:27:13	@EC	Like the relation between a book and its tables of contents
2013-08-13 17:27:26	jonathanwallace	the bigger changes will fall out from changing how publishing works
2013-08-13 17:27:27	@EC	Well let’s start there since that’s a big change
2013-08-13 17:27:57	@EC	We can start by tackling the rename. As people free up from that or need more work we’ll start working through other things.
2013-08-13 17:28:14	jonathanwallace	i don't think the rename will take very long
2013-08-13 17:28:15	@EC	And in the meantime I’ll try to get out ahead with a plan
2013-08-13 17:28:27	jonathanwallace	k
2013-08-13 17:28:31	@EC	As for naming
2013-08-13 17:28:39	jonathanwallace	Bookshelf?
2013-08-13 17:28:41	@EC	“Book” and “Page” are definitely the right models
2013-08-13 17:28:43	jonathanwallace	h/t to aubrey 
2013-08-13 17:29:07	@EC	Bookshelf and “books” were the names Kennard and I tossed around for the namespace
2013-08-13 17:29:25	@EC	The UI will likely display “Books” or “Bookshelf” as the section name
2013-08-13 17:29:47	@EC	With “Pages” and “Titles”/“Books”/“Volumes” as the sub-sections
2013-08-13 17:30:20	@EC	Very long term the intent is that a document type is not limited to a certain navigation module in RetailMe
2013-08-13 17:30:32	jonathanwallace	gotcha
2013-08-13 17:30:47	@EC	For example, a content creator is not limited to storing lessons in “Training”
2013-08-13 17:31:03	@EC	The Mac UI will probably be organized around document type
2013-08-13 17:31:18	@EC	But someday content creators may be able to file documents in any section of RetailMe
2013-08-13 17:31:22	gaffneyc	EC: Haven't seen any of the exceptions from the passenger upgrade we saw last time. Hoping it's a good upgrade this time :fingers crossed:
2013-08-13 17:31:22	@EC	Lessons in “Materials”
2013-08-13 17:31:32	@EC	Books in “Training”
2013-08-13 17:31:33	@EC	etc.
2013-08-13 17:31:43	jonathanwallace	that makes sense
2013-08-13 17:31:52	@EC	So I’m inclined to name this code module “Books” after the type of document 
2013-08-13 17:32:16	@EC	gaffneyc: Me neither. Off to a great start.
2013-08-13 17:32:21	jonathanwallace	that sounds good to me
2013-08-13 17:32:28	jonathanwallace	i've got to run for this evening
2013-08-13 17:32:32	@EC	jonathanwallace: k
2013-08-13 17:32:44	@EC	Should we call it a day for today and pick this up tomorrow?
2013-08-13 17:32:56	@EC	Or aubrey and pamela do you want to continue talking about this?
2013-08-13 17:33:17	greggroth	What are you thoughts on aubrey's go_live question
2013-08-13 17:34:09	greggroth	If a book is published, does it publish all of it's pages irrespective of go lives?
2013-08-13 17:34:10	@EC	greggroth: That was the comment you left for me yesterday/2 days ago?
2013-08-13 17:34:39	 *	EC recalls the decision on publishing
2013-08-13 17:34:47	greggroth	My orginal comment was that we were going to publish pages and books separately, but Kurt said that's not the case anymore
2013-08-13 17:34:54	 *	EC consults with Kennard
2013-08-13 17:36:57	aubrey	So, one option is to leave page go_lives alone, and then only let them publish for the books locale (hard coded to en-US for now)
2013-08-13 17:37:43	###	You are now known as gregg
2013-08-13 17:37:55	aubrey	another thing I'm concerned about is the way we're storing the TOC data on the server side now. we just treat it as a dumb blob that we pass back and forth. now we'll need to parse it to pull out the page ids to publish them
2013-08-13 17:38:19	aubrey	should we think about validating the structure of the table of contents now?
2013-08-13 17:38:36	<--	jonathanwallace (~jonathanw@17.153.96.237) has quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
2013-08-13 17:38:42	aubrey	(I also need to run in 5 minutes, sorry about that)
2013-08-13 17:39:54	@EC	That’s more than I can answer in 5 minutes so I’ll stick to the publication question
2013-08-13 17:40:05	@EC	The intent is to remove the concept of a go-live from the page level
2013-08-13 17:40:27	@EC	In lieu of all publication happening through the book (which is really a TOC)
2013-08-13 17:40:39	@EC	So a content creator would open the TOC for a locale
2013-08-13 17:40:48	@EC	Nope, sorry
2013-08-13 17:40:55	@EC	They would open a book
2013-08-13 17:40:58	gregg	a page is published if and only if it is referenced by a book's TOC?
2013-08-13 17:41:00	@EC	Check off a list of countries
2013-08-13 17:41:01	@EC	And hit publish
2013-08-13 17:41:06	@EC	Correct
2013-08-13 17:41:09	gregg	:+1:
2013-08-13 17:41:13	@EC	Specifically, by the TOC for a locale
2013-08-13 17:41:24	@EC	A book actually has many TOCs
2013-08-13 17:41:31	@EC	That’s how localization will happen
2013-08-13 17:41:41	aubrey	ok, that makes sense
2013-08-13 17:41:41	@EC	But we’re probably getting ahead of ourselves
2013-08-13 17:41:57	@EC	And what we haven’t resolved yet is republication
2013-08-13 17:42:04	@EC	For example, the case of “I made a typo”
2013-08-13 17:42:25	@EC	I think we’d like to preserve the option to republish just a single page
2013-08-13 17:42:32	@EC	But I’m not sure if we’ll retain that or not
2013-08-13 17:42:42	@EC	A separate story, for sure
2013-08-13 17:42:53	@EC	aubrey: Does that answer the question?
2013-08-13 17:43:10	aubrey	I think at one point we talked about treating book publications as "editions" and (re)publishing every page during book publication
2013-08-13 17:43:15	aubrey	but yeah that's another story
2013-08-13 17:43:18	@EC	We did
2013-08-13 17:43:19	aubrey	yep I think so
2013-08-13 17:43:27	@EC	I’m also not sure that has survived
2013-08-13 17:43:33	@EC	But we can talk about how that would work if it does survive
2013-08-13 17:43:40	aubrey	ah ok
2013-08-13 17:43:43	@EC	aubrey: Does it raise new questions regarding publication?
2013-08-13 17:43:50	@EC	At least for the most basic publication case?
2013-08-13 17:43:55	aubrey	I don't think so
2013-08-13 17:44:03	aubrey	it may as we work through it
2013-08-13 17:44:04	@EC	Ok
2013-08-13 17:44:08	@EC	I expect it will :)
2013-08-13 17:44:10	gregg	I think I understand enough to get working
2013-08-13 17:44:14	@EC	Sweet
2013-08-13 17:44:24	@EC	I think tomorrow I will be doing nothing but Compass
2013-08-13 17:44:28	aubrey	I think the bigger issue we're facing now is parsing the TOC to get the page ids
2013-08-13 17:44:33	gregg	agreed
2013-08-13 17:44:40	aubrey	it might be good to chat about that a little tomorrow
2013-08-13 17:44:44	@EC	Let’s do that
2013-08-13 17:44:51	aubrey	great
2013-08-13 17:44:52	gregg	hopefully they've had enough time that the TOC scheme has settled
2013-08-13 17:44:55	aubrey	with that, I'm off
2013-08-13 17:44:57	aubrey	thanks EC 
2013-08-13 17:44:58	@EC	I’d kind of like to just work through these changes as you guys are working through them
2013-08-13 17:45:01	gregg	Thanks EC!
2013-08-13 17:45:08	@EC	Later guys!

2013-08-14 15:49:09	aubrey	the api endpoints might get a little confusing
2013-08-14 15:49:27	aubrey	like we'd be changing "api/compass/books" to "api/books/books"
2013-08-14 15:50:16	jonathanwallace	"api/books/all" ?
2013-08-14 15:50:29	aubrey	but then what about pages?
2013-08-14 15:50:44	aubrey	right now it's "api/compass/pages"
2013-08-14 15:51:02	laserlemon	in the past, [i] has had apis that have multiple services
2013-08-14 15:51:23	laserlemon	if we had a "books" service that had a "books" resource and a "pages" resource, we'd do the naming how you're describing

2013-08-14 16:16:59	jonathanwallace	aubrey's been working on the rename. pamela and greggroth are working on updating the publishing details for books.

2013-08-14 16:30:25	jonathanwallace	gaffneyc: is there a JIRA ticket to spin down intersect-train and remove the capistrano deploy file?

2013-08-14 16:34:51	gaffneyc	*not

2013-08-14 16:41:01	gaffneyc	Okay, lets get the process kicked off.
2013-08-14 16:41:31	greggroth	:+1:
2013-08-14 16:41:38	gaffneyc	EC: I want to rebuild the intersect-dev load balancer at some point. Thinking of just having it be intersect.apple.com… though I think we already have -dev on the VPN white list and what not
2013-08-14 16:41:42	greggroth	so books will continue to be published only in en-US?
2013-08-14 16:41:43	@EC	jonathanwallace: It would be great to do some exploration on how well Mongo/Mongoid handle huge TOC entries
2013-08-14 16:41:51	@EC	jonathanwallace: Want to work on that next?
2013-08-14 16:41:52	greggroth	therefore, pages as well
2013-08-14 16:42:05	jonathanwallace	EC: sure
2013-08-14 16:42:47	@EC	jonathanwallace: Try something like a TOC with 1200 collections and 120000 pages
2013-08-14 16:43:06	@EC	jonathanwallace: And maybe some collections nested up to 50 levels
2013-08-14 16:43:42	@EC	gaffneyc: -dev is on the whitelist
2013-08-14 16:43:57	@EC	gaffneyc: intersect.apple.com is as well, I believe
2013-08-14 16:44:21	gaffneyc	Can investigate
2013-08-14 16:44:25	@EC	gaffneyc: And yes, we need to either get that proxy up and running really well or tear it down and install real SSL certs. everywhere
2013-08-14 16:44:40	gaffneyc	Yeah
2013-08-14 16:44:46	@EC	greggroth: In release 1 books will only publish in en-US
2013-08-14 16:44:48	gaffneyc	How well has the proxy been working?
2013-08-14 16:45:03	@EC	greggroth: We should design in a way where we can easily support publication to multiple locales, though
2013-08-14 16:45:34	@EC	gaffneyc: If you listen to casual commentary it has caused slowdowns and timeouts
2013-08-14 16:45:43	@EC	No one has confirmed it’s the proxy’s fault
2013-08-14 16:45:51	@EC	Dru may be able to tell you more on that
2013-08-14 16:47:03	@EC	greggroth: Our data structures should support the addition of multiple locales, that is
2013-08-14 16:47:20	@EC	greggroth: We don’t necessarily need to add all the code needed to enable multiple locales now
2013-08-14 16:47:27	@EC	Like snippeting, translations, etc.
2013-08-14 16:47:35	@EC	As long as there’s a place for them later
2013-08-14 16:48:24	gaffneyc	EC: How many dev environments are we going to be using right now?
2013-08-14 16:48:28	gaffneyc	The current 4?
2013-08-14 16:50:11	@EC	Yep
2013-08-14 16:51:02	greggroth	I don't think it would be difficult to extend the current method to allow for multiple locales via go_lives
2013-08-14 16:51:59	@EC	jonathanwallace: There’s one more case to test: take one of those large TOCs and store it as an embedded object; then copy it 50 times. I.e. a book with embedded TOCs that has 50 large TOCs.
2013-08-14 16:52:06	@EC	jonathanwallace: Make sense?
2013-08-14 16:52:34	@EC	jonathanwallace: We’re looking for limits here.
2013-08-14 16:52:57	jonathanwallace	k
2013-08-14 16:53:28	gaffneyc	Just noticed that dev1 has push_notifications queue configured but no certificate
2013-08-14 16:53:42	gaffneyc	So it's causing one core to be full dedicated to trying to boot it
2013-08-14 16:53:53	@EC	Kill it
2013-08-14 16:54:00	@EC	We only need push notifications on -dev4
2013-08-14 16:54:32	gaffneyc	Do we need reports or translations at all?
2013-08-14 16:54:36	gaffneyc	*queues
2013-08-14 16:54:42	@EC	Nope
2013-08-14 16:56:12	gaffneyc	We've run into this issue in a number of pre-production environments
2013-08-14 17:00:39	@EC	aubrey: Let’s just forgo a namespace in the routes for now
2013-08-14 17:00:43	@EC	aubrey: /api/books
2013-08-14 17:00:48	@EC	aubrey: /api/pages
2013-08-14 17:01:13	@EC	aubrey: We’ll keep the models, controllers—all the internal stuff under “Books” for now
2013-08-14 17:01:36	@EC	aubrey: One direction we may take in future enhancements is to restrict pages to a specific book
2013-08-14 17:01:58	@EC	aubrey: In which case routes may look something like /api/books/2384uskf2fu8fuifsf/pages/rhjsfshu18923iuf
2013-08-14 17:02:16	@EC	Or /api/books/f8ydsufuherff/pages
2013-08-14 17:02:24	@EC	etc.
2013-08-14 17:02:28	@EC	aubrey: Sound good?
2013-08-14 17:03:56	@EC	gaffneyc: I have target passwords for you for Thursday
2013-08-14 17:04:05	@EC	gaffneyc: Are you in Bubb 8 so I can give you the key?
2013-08-14 17:04:31	gaffneyc	EC: Yeah, I can stop over to 11 as well
2013-08-14 17:04:45	@EC	I need a coffe
2013-08-14 17:04:46	@EC	e

2013-08-14 17:06:15	@EC	Didn’t see you left
2013-08-14 17:06:32	aubrey	what about the creator routes? right now they're /api/creator/compass/books or /api/creator/compass/pages
2013-08-14 17:06:45	@EC	There were 9 messages. Get ‘em all?
2013-08-14 17:07:01	@EC	aubrey: How about /api/creator/books
2013-08-14 17:07:07	aubrey	here's what jonathanwallace sent: https://gist.github.com/wallace/9029190d59e14daeb12f
2013-08-14 17:07:24	@EC	aubrey: Yep, that looks right
2013-08-14 17:07:36	@EC	aubrey: Same on Creator side regarding internal namespacing
2013-08-14 17:07:52	@EC	aubrey: Creator::Books::Book/Page
2013-08-14 17:08:04	aubrey	ok, that makes sense to me
2013-08-14 17:08:23	@EC	aubrey: Just the route naming where we’ll omit a namespace. For now, at least.
2013-08-14 17:08:25	aubrey	I'll coordinate with the MC guys to make sure that change won't trip them up
2013-08-14 17:08:26	@EC	Easy change.
2013-08-14 17:08:40	@EC	aubrey: k. They’ll probably be grumpy.
2013-08-14 17:09:00	@EC	aubrey: I think we may have a couple changes that they will need to adapt to. Kennard knows about them but not sure MC does.
2013-08-14 17:09:50	aubrey	I don't think this one should be too big of an issue for them

2013-08-19 13:22:51	@EC	greggroth: I have updates for you on publishing and a question about what’s most useful for you from me next
2013-08-19 13:23:52	@EC	greggroth: On the update: worked through some more detail on the content creator experience for publishing a book (like Compass)
2013-08-19 13:24:44	@EC	We know we’re using an on-demand model rather than a scheduling model. I.e. push a button, publish your book rather than set a time at which your book will publish.
2013-08-19 13:25:14	@EC	We’re headed towards a model where the content creator puts in work orders when they push the button
2013-08-19 13:25:34	@EC	So they may press “Publish” and a sheet will appear with a list of all countries Apple operates in
2013-08-19 13:25:54	@EC	The content creator specifies the state for each country: published; removed/blank/not published.
2013-08-19 13:26:15	@EC	When they confirm the sheet by pressing “Ok” a publication order is sent to the server.
2013-08-19 13:26:27	@EC	With details about what the state should be in each country.
2013-08-19 13:29:30	@EC	The publication system then works the order to make the state consistent in each country with the content creator’s order.
2013-08-19 13:29:46	@EC	Means we will likely not need to keep go-lives on books or pages.
2013-08-19 13:29:53	@EC	Now here’s the question:
2013-08-19 13:30:10	@EC	We’ve only gotten a little closer to the details of what the publication experience needs to be like
2013-08-19 13:30:28	@EC	I need to sketch it out in more explicit detail so we’ll know exactly what to build
2013-08-19 13:30:51	@EC	Is it more useful to you today for me to keep sketching that out or to review the publication branch you submitted last week?
2013-08-19 13:31:07	@EC	I have to go to a meeting. Back in an hour.
2013-08-19 13:39:30	greggroth	EC:  Aubrey went ahead and merged my branch to address publication (CMP-1055):  https://code.apple.com/RetailSoftwareEngineering/intersect/pull/709
2013-08-19 13:39:47	greggroth	It sounds like what I did falls in line with what you want.

2013-08-19 15:21:26	@EC	Or would it be better for me to review changes of the last week for feedback?

2013-08-20 13:33:33	aubrey	pamela and greggroth have been working on refactoring publishing some
2013-08-20 13:34:00	pamela	Yep, that is my current status
2013-08-20 13:34:40	@EC	aubrey: I have refactors for you
2013-08-20 13:34:58	@EC	Let me pull them up
2013-08-20 13:35:01	aubrey	EC: I'd be happy to jump on them
2013-08-20 13:38:13	@EC	So probably the next best one is related to tables-of-contents
2013-08-20 13:38:34	@EC	Let me tell you where we’re eventually going and then we’ll come back to what we need now
2013-08-20 13:38:44	aubrey	alright
2013-08-20 13:38:57	@EC	In this first release we’re not bothering with localization and translation beyond en-US
2013-08-20 13:39:23	@EC	But if Compass is successful I expect our next release will be focused on adding localization and translation
2013-08-20 13:39:29	@EC	Just like we do with all other documents
2013-08-20 13:39:56	@EC	Because books are volumes of documents
2013-08-20 13:40:04	@EC	They present a new localization challenge
2013-08-20 13:40:14	@EC	Whereas before we only had to localize an individual document
2013-08-20 13:40:32	@EC	Now we have to localize the *collection* or map of documents included in a book
2013-08-20 13:40:42	@EC	For example, China may have no Personal Setup service
2013-08-20 13:40:59	@EC	So a chapter on Personal Setup that applies in all other countries may need to be removed from the Chinese version of the book
2013-08-20 13:41:11	@EC	How do you think we will do that?
2013-08-20 13:42:03	aubrey	would it make sense to just have a book for each locale? 
2013-08-20 13:42:17	@EC	Tell me more
2013-08-20 13:44:24	aubrey	Basically just specify which locale a book is for, and then create a new one for each new locale. I think it depends how much overlap there is between locales for weather this makes sense.
2013-08-20 13:44:58	aubrey	But for compass we would have Compass us-EN edition, compass fr-FR edition and so on, each with their own table of contents
2013-08-20 13:45:11	@EC	Yep. We could.
2013-08-20 13:45:22	aubrey	what were you thinking?
2013-08-20 13:46:23	@EC	As a content creator do I have to create 19 books if I need to reach all countries, then?
2013-08-20 13:46:54	@EC	Lot to maintain.
2013-08-20 13:47:40	@EC	It’s pretty close to what we’re going to attempt, though.
2013-08-20 13:47:59	@EC	Instead of multiple books we’ll use multiple tables-of-contents
2013-08-20 13:48:04	@EC	Each with its own locale
2013-08-20 13:48:38	@EC	The UI will probably be similar to the UI in other document types
2013-08-20 13:48:59	@EC	Once you open a book in Mac you’ll start at a global-English TOC
2013-08-20 13:49:25	@EC	You can flip to a different locale using the traditional locale-switcher button at upper-right
2013-08-20 13:49:48	@EC	*If* you modify the TOC in that locale at that point a brand new TOC would be created for that locale
2013-08-20 13:49:58	greggroth	we could just translate the TOC attribute on books
2013-08-20 13:50:12	@EC	greggroth: We could.
2013-08-20 13:50:19	@EC	What happens when the TOC gets really big?
2013-08-20 13:50:38	@EC	Hundreds of collections and a thousand or more pages?
2013-08-20 13:51:03	greggroth	mongodb can handle large documents (I'll find a citation), so it comes down to how mongoid handles it.  I think jonathanwallace is looking into that now
2013-08-20 13:51:08	@EC	And now you have potentially 19 or more TOCs in the same record?
2013-08-20 13:51:34	@EC	It does handle large documents well. Up to 16MB.
2013-08-20 13:51:38	jonathanwallace	greggroth: EC and i reviewed the mongodb limitations and they aren't encouraging
2013-08-20 13:51:40	jonathanwallace	IMHO
2013-08-20 13:51:54	@EC	Probably a limit we won’t reach for a typical book for a single TOC
2013-08-20 13:51:56	 *	jonathanwallace doesn't consider 16MB to be super large
2013-08-20 13:52:11	@EC	But if we try to embed multiple TOCs we’ll hit that limit much faster
2013-08-20 13:52:22	greggroth	actually MongoDB isn't as awesome as I thought -- 16 MB is the limit for a BSON Object:  http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/limits/
2013-08-20 13:52:32	jonathanwallace	ha, yep
2013-08-20 13:52:45	greggroth	ah I see y'all beat me to it  :-P
2013-08-20 13:52:53	@EC	aubrey: The goal is to make a TOC its own object in its own record
2013-08-20 13:53:04	@EC	aubrey: I.e. a 1-n referenced relation
2013-08-20 13:53:10	@EC	Book has many TOCs
2013-08-20 13:53:17	greggroth	then I think that's a good argument for aubrey's suggestion of maintaining separate books
2013-08-20 13:53:26	greggroth	or that
2013-08-20 13:53:44	@EC	greggroth: It’s pretty much the same idea just done at a different level
2013-08-20 13:53:49	aubrey	it depends on if we're going to be adding more attributes to books
2013-08-20 13:53:58	aubrey	right now it's just title and toc
2013-08-20 13:54:14	@EC	aubrey: Can you give an example?
2013-08-20 13:55:21	aubrey	honestly I can't think of anything right now, but anything that would be shared between the translated editions
2013-08-20 13:55:49	aubrey	but yes, they are basically the same idea
2013-08-20 13:56:14	@EC	There’s more to it
2013-08-20 13:56:26	@EC	But that seems like the next basic building block refactor we should do
2013-08-20 13:56:31	@EC	Turn TOC into its own model
2013-08-20 13:56:37	@EC	In its own collection
2013-08-20 13:56:42	@EC	And relate it to a book
2013-08-20 13:57:02	aubrey	would we be exposing this change to the client yet?
2013-08-20 13:58:44	@EC	Well…eventually the API representation of a book will be basic attributes like title, id, who has it checked out and a map of identifiers to its TOCs
2013-08-20 13:58:50	@EC	With each TOC retrieved separately
2013-08-20 13:59:01	@EC	Longterm we’ll need a TOC route for a book
2013-08-20 13:59:19	@EC	For now, though, the API representation is probably fine as-is
2013-08-20 13:59:49	@EC	As long as the internal server structure prepares for that we can adjust the client-server communication later
2013-08-20 14:00:24	aubrey	ok, that makes sense to me
2013-08-20 14:01:31	@EC	aubrey: I suppose for now what we should do is create a default TOC with a locale of “en-ZZ” when a new book is created
2013-08-20 14:01:46	@EC	Since the client will not be creating separate TOCs at this time
2013-08-20 14:02:54	@EC	Since Mongoid has no concept of migrations I’m not sure if it’s easier to model a Book to TOC relationship as has_one/belongs_to with the intent to migrate that to has_many later or just start with has_many
2013-08-20 14:03:35	aubrey	I was thinking of starting off with has_many so there's nothing to change down the road
2013-08-20 14:03:40	jonathanwallace	:aubrey:++
2013-08-20 14:03:46	@EC	I don’t think that’s a bad idea
2013-08-20 14:04:08	@EC	Especially because as we write publication logic it will force us to consider the presence of multiple TOCs
2013-08-20 14:04:22	@EC	Even if we don’t put in full translation logic
2013-08-20 14:05:01	aubrey	will this be mirrored on the published side, books having many tocs?
2013-08-20 14:05:17	@EC	aubrey: Yep
2013-08-20 14:06:26	aubrey	EC anything else I should keep in mind?
2013-08-20 14:10:32	@EC	Sorry…received a cube visit
2013-08-20 14:10:34	@EC	Checking!
2013-08-20 14:11:25	@EC	Nothing at this time
2013-08-20 14:11:45	aubrey	alright, I'll get to work then
2013-08-20 14:11:50	@EC	There’s much more complexity to add/refactor but let’s take them one at a time
2013-08-20 14:12:20	@EC	greggroth, pamela: The next big conceptual refactor will probably affect you in publication
2013-08-20 14:12:25	aubrey	great, I'll let you know once I finish up with this
2013-08-20 14:12:35	@EC	aubrey: Thank you!
2013-08-20 14:13:14	greggroth	EC  how so?  Is there something we can do to prepare for it?
2013-08-20 14:13:51	greggroth	we're nearly finished removing the old `#publish_to_intersect` style of publication in favor the new publisher-object method.
2013-08-20 14:17:08	@EC	greggroth: I’d say wrap up that refactor and then let’s talk.
2013-08-20 14:17:34	@EC	The summary is: we’ll need to publish editions.
2013-08-20 14:18:10	greggroth	ok
2013-08-20 14:18:20	@EC	I.e. more than one publication of a book may exist simultaneously.
2013-08-20 14:19:06	greggroth	I don't think that would be too much troble.
2013-08-20 14:19:20	@EC	No, I don’t think it’s as scary as it might sound.
2013-08-20 14:19:33	@EC	Though there’s much support material around it.
2013-08-20 14:19:39	greggroth	I suspect an `edition` attribute on the training side may suffice.
2013-08-20 14:19:46	@EC	So it’s probably bigger than you think. :)
2013-08-20 14:19:53	greggroth	heh  things typically are.
2013-08-20 14:20:21	@EC	I’ve got the longterm map in front of me. I’m going to use the next few hours to slice it up into iterative steps so we can do as little as needed now.
2013-08-20 14:20:33	greggroth	perfect

2013-08-20 14:33:47	@EC	pamela: Possibly. I have to re-aquaint myself with all the plans every 3 months because something inevitably distracts me inbetween.
2013-08-20 14:34:25	pamela	that's fair! I think there's a lot of chatter that I've absorbed in getting acclimated that is now obsolete
2013-08-20 14:35:03	@EC	pamela: How are you feeling about the application after a month now?
2013-08-20 14:36:01	pamela	Lots of moving parts, but there are discernible paths between them... just takes a little while to learn how to unearth those paths
2013-08-20 14:36:57	@EC	I’ll wager it takes a long while :)
2013-08-20 14:37:23	@EC	Just when you think you understand it a new layer will get pulled back

2013-08-27 11:42:22	laserlemon	just commented on it. we're stumped so we're crossing our fingers that it's your fault ;)

2013-08-27 12:36:43	laserlemon	whew!
2013-08-27 12:36:44	druibarra	but i'm getting failed syncs now...
2013-08-27 12:36:51	laserlemon	what are the failures?
2013-08-27 12:42:04	druibarra	not sure. but the sync records shows a number_failed count
2013-08-27 12:54:34	laserlemon	druibarra: that could be for any number of reasons. we discovered during our work on this that the number passed/failed was totally broken
2013-08-27 12:54:39	laserlemon	and always reporting all as passed
2013-08-27 12:54:47	laserlemon	fun stuff
2013-08-27 12:55:19	druibarra	interesting. i'm seeing all as failed now
2013-08-27 12:56:37	laserlemon	probably because they all are
2013-08-27 12:56:43	laserlemon	(and have been for a while)
2013-08-27 12:59:35	ErsatzRyan	laserlemon: druibarra: that is because we were missing a commit on that branch it is pushed now
2013-08-27 12:59:44	ErsatzRyan	i'm not sure if that branch was merged in or not
2013-08-27 12:59:54	ErsatzRyan	perhaps we should make a new PR for the commit that was missing

2013-08-27 13:16:07	aubrey	all of my critiques just echo what's already in the comments and I can't think of a way to make activerecord behave better there
2013-08-27 13:16:21	laserlemon	yeah, nor can we
2013-08-27 13:16:27	laserlemon	spent way too much time trying
2013-08-27 13:21:06	laserlemon	druibarra: is there any way that *we* can perform a sync against net promoter like you are?
2013-08-27 13:21:28	laserlemon	*against medallia, rather
2013-08-27 13:22:08	laserlemon	it seems as though the conversion to net promoter survey is failing validation
2013-08-27 13:22:17	laserlemon	so we'd need to see what data we're getting from medallia
2013-08-27 13:25:22	druibarra	i can pull the data for you
2013-08-27 13:25:34	laserlemon	wonderful

2013-08-27 13:26:14	laserlemon	spoiler alert: nobody will
2013-08-27 13:26:14	aubrey	yep, I can merge it in if it's ready
2013-08-27 13:26:29	laserlemon	it's a go as far as we're concerned!
2013-08-27 13:26:32	aubrey	okidoke
2013-08-27 13:33:49	laserlemon	druibarra: let me know when you have that data. i believe that's our last story in the iteration. should we move it back to development for now?
2013-08-27 13:33:56	laserlemon	are *you* qa on that story?
2013-08-27 13:34:17	druibarra	yeah i'm QA on it
2013-08-27 13:34:28	laserlemon	cool

2013-09-05 17:07:11	aubrey	laserlemon: left a comment, yeah that's what I had in mind
2013-09-05 17:54:39	laserlemon	EC: is there anything i can do to help with https://greenhopper.apple.com/browse/RMEEHB-256
2013-09-05 17:55:29	@EC	laserlemon: Yes – let me figure out how to articulate it
2013-09-05 17:56:00	@EC	Would you like to:
2013-09-05 17:56:24	@EC	1) Using a brand-new, empty database create a message using RetailMe Mac
2013-09-05 17:56:44	@EC	2) Duplicate it so there are 60 copies—one on each of the last 60 days
2013-09-05 17:57:10	@EC	Abandoning these instructions
2013-09-05 17:57:20	laserlemon	(wiping brain…)
2013-09-05 17:57:26	@EC	Basically, create and deliver a message for each of last 60 days
2013-09-05 17:57:35	@EC	Then view the result in RetailMe touch and see if it works as expected
2013-09-05 17:57:55	@EC	I highly suspect the issue QA is experiencing is related to their data
2013-09-05 17:58:08	laserlemon	i expect updated_at is the issue
2013-09-05 17:58:21	laserlemon	we should be using some other timestamp to re-up messages
2013-09-05 17:58:23	@EC	Using known-good data to verify the issue will help nail that down
2013-09-05 17:59:03	laserlemon	i'll see if i can figure out how to create "old" messages/deliveries through real mac client channels
2013-09-05 17:59:14	laserlemon	do i need the latest mac build and where can i grab it?
2013-09-05 18:00:21	@EC	https://retailme.apple.com/mac/download/RetailMe-Latest.zip
2013-09-05 18:00:52	@EC	laserlemon: Easiest way is to use Mac to create the message
2013-09-05 18:00:59	@EC	Then the console to dupe and deliver messages
2013-09-05 18:01:17	@EC	Just be careful to deliver exactly as the publication logic would
2013-09-05 18:02:30	laserlemon	i'll try
2013-09-05 18:15:16	<--	aubrey (~aubrey@17.153.32.59) has quit (Quit: My MacBook Pro has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
2013-09-05 18:27:53	laserlemon	i can deliver like they would in the wild but the sent_at values are all set to now
2013-09-05 18:27:56	laserlemon	same with updated_at
2013-09-05 18:28:44	laserlemon	so i'm having the same problem that QA would. should i manually manipulate the data to verify the correct behavior?
2013-09-05 18:29:46	laserlemon	EC: ^

2013-09-05 18:36:35	@EC	Yes. I don’t know of a better way.
2013-09-05 18:40:08	laserlemon	ok
2013-09-05 18:49:34	laserlemon	EC: on my local setup, i created 60 messages starting today and going back in time a day at a time
2013-09-05 18:49:39	laserlemon	sent_at and updated_at
2013-09-05 18:49:51	laserlemon	logged into next_release of retailme touch
2013-09-05 18:50:07	laserlemon	i see a messages count badge of 29
2013-09-05 18:50:27	laserlemon	and it looks accurate in the list. my messages only go back to august 7 in the list
2013-09-05 18:51:04	@EC	Badge count match the message list count?
2013-09-05 18:51:24	laserlemon	at first, yes. until it started marking some as read
2013-09-05 18:51:33	@EC	Splendid
2013-09-05 18:52:15	@EC	I’m satisfied the feature is working right. You?
2013-09-05 18:53:18	laserlemon	yes. the only thing that concerns me is production data
2013-09-05 18:53:34	laserlemon	if updated_at timestamps are recent because of… who knows why
2013-09-05 18:53:40	laserlemon	messages will still show up
2013-09-05 18:53:45	laserlemon	in the list and badge
2013-09-05 18:54:23	@EC	I posted some updates on the story that may be relevant
2013-09-05 18:54:56	@EC	We should move away from the updated_at field as our restoration hack
2013-09-05 18:55:14	@EC	Or do away with restoration period
2013-09-05 18:55:50	@EC	We might be able to now that we have set the expectation with Market Support that messages *can* only be viewed for up to 30 days
2013-09-05 18:55:59	@EC	Rather than 30 days or anything you haven't read yet
2013-09-05 18:58:06	laserlemon	right. anything more we need done for this story/iteration on the server side. or is this where we want to be for now?
2013-09-05 18:59:17	laserlemon	EC: ^
2013-09-05 18:59:59	@EC	Stay for now. I’ll propose ending the restoration service and see what the reaction is like.
2013-09-05 19:00:28	@EC	Running final test on next-release now
2013-09-05 19:00:42	@EC	Barring additional issues will deploy tonight
2013-09-05 19:00:49	laserlemon	great. i'll be on a little while longer working on some open source. let me know if you need me

2013-09-06 11:36:02	laserlemon	EC: we have some questions about training course publication
2013-09-06 11:36:08	laserlemon	and how it's *supposed* to work
2013-09-06 11:36:27	@EC	Shoot
2013-09-06 11:36:41	laserlemon	if i create lessons in a course and that's all supposed to publish in canada only
2013-09-06 11:36:47	laserlemon	but my country is germany
2013-09-06 11:36:59	laserlemon	when those are published, i don't see them
2013-09-06 11:37:05	laserlemon	i assume that's proper behavior
2013-09-06 11:37:12	laserlemon	can you confirm that?
2013-09-06 11:37:51	laserlemon	(relates to: https://greenhopper.apple.com/browse/RMEEHB-282)
2013-09-06 11:40:47	@EC	If you created a lesson, scheduled it for publication in Canada, attached it to a course and published it an employee in Germany would see neither the course nor the lesson but an employee in Canada would see both.
2013-09-06 11:41:42	@EC	If you then created a second lesson, scheduled it for publication in Germany, attached it to the same course and published it an employee in Germany would see the course and the German lesson but not the Canadian lesson
2013-09-06 11:41:54	@EC	And an employee in Canada would see the course and Canadian lesson but not the German lesson
2013-09-06 11:42:20	laserlemon	digesting…
2013-09-06 11:43:42	laserlemon	bingo. got it. and that behavior makes no exception for the lessons' creators, right?
2013-09-06 11:44:01	greggroth	EC  Should much should a publication order be concerned about a publishing job failing?  At the moment, the percentage complete will be hung at some number less than 100 since the number of completed docs is less than the total number of docs.  Should it stay that way or do something more sophisticated?
2013-09-06 11:44:03	@EC	Can you clarify?
2013-09-06 11:44:17	greggroth	*how much
2013-09-06 11:44:30	@EC	greggroth: Question noted. Standby.
2013-09-06 11:44:58	laserlemon	EC: if the lesson creator's country is germany, and he creates a lesson for publication in canada
2013-09-06 11:45:20	laserlemon	he doesn't get special treatment where he could somehow still see that lesson
2013-09-06 11:45:28	@EC	laserlemon: Correct.
2013-09-06 11:45:37	laserlemon	thank you. he's all yours greggroth!
2013-09-06 11:45:37	@EC	The creator will be able to see the lesson in RetailMe Mac
2013-09-06 11:45:45	@EC	But would then not be able to view it on RetailMe touch
2013-09-06 11:45:49	laserlemon	yup, cool
2013-09-06 11:45:55	@EC	Unless they have the ability to change their country
2013-09-06 11:46:00	@EC	Which Market Support employees do
2013-09-06 11:47:17	@EC	greggroth: I’ll give the end-goal first then we can talk about when and how to get there
2013-09-06 11:47:25	greggroth	k
2013-09-06 11:47:46	@EC	greggroth: To give content creators more awareness about what’s happening in the system
2013-09-06 11:48:38	@EC	Ideally, if any component of a publication fails the error will be recorded and provided to the content creator through some interface like RetailMe Mac or maybe email, where appropriate
2013-09-06 11:48:52	@EC	I haven’t invested much thought on details
2013-09-06 11:49:22	@EC	But my starting point would be to look at the publication order as having many errors
2013-09-06 11:49:37	greggroth	That's an interesting thought -- I can look into whether the publication order and report failures
2013-09-06 11:49:47	@EC	And a client-server representation of the order would include any errors to-date
2013-09-06 11:49:48	greggroth	*can
2013-09-06 11:49:59	greggroth	ok.  I'll start working on that.
2013-09-06 11:50:08	greggroth	This is my progress thus far:  https://code.apple.com/RetailSoftwareEngineering/intersect/pull/757
2013-09-06 11:50:13	@EC	That way RetailMe Mac can take the list and present it to content creators in a meaningful way
2013-09-06 11:50:59	@EC	greggroth: It could be as simple as if a publication job fails it calls back to the publication order and reports the failure
2013-09-06 11:51:35	@EC	“I’m job X and I failed. Here’s my failure message.”
2013-09-06 11:52:02	@EC	Then the order could distinguish between jobs that haven’t reported back, jobs that have completed and jobs that have failed
2013-09-06 11:52:28	greggroth	I think that's a good route.
2013-09-06 11:53:01	@EC	greggroth: Thanks for taking error handling and reporting into consideration.
2013-09-06 11:53:05	@EC	Easy to overlook.
2013-09-06 11:53:25	@EC	But is a common use case in any application.
2013-09-06 11:53:33	@EC	How things work when they don’t work.
2013-09-06 11:54:22	greggroth	definitely.  I've seen the resque admin page enough to know that we need to plan for errors
2013-09-06 11:54:25	greggroth	:-)
2013-09-06 11:54:48	@EC	lol
2013-09-06 11:54:50	@EC	Yes.

2013-09-13 13:41:35	laserlemon	got a question for you
2013-09-13 13:42:17	laserlemon	we're looking at the discussions timeline controller and saw that we return *all* posts for admins, rather than just authorized/appropriate/etc.
2013-09-13 13:42:20	laserlemon	https://code.apple.com/RetailSoftwareEngineering/intersect/blob/master/app/controllers/discussions/timeline_controller.rb#L3
2013-09-13 13:42:45	laserlemon	but it looks like we're using "messages_admin" rather than "discussions_admin." does that seem right to you?

2013-09-18 14:16:31	@EC	greggroth: Have a couple minutes to talk about the iOS7/Mavericks project?
2013-09-18 14:23:06	greggroth	yep
2013-09-18 14:23:14	greggroth	prefer here on on a call?
2013-09-18 14:33:32	@EC	Here’s good
2013-09-18 14:34:01	@EC	greggroth: I’ve heard that the iOS7/Mavericks client builds include some server-side changes
2013-09-18 14:34:14	@EC	Do you know about any of those?
2013-09-18 14:34:22	@EC	One’s related to grid item representations?
2013-09-18 14:35:11	-->	pamela (~pwnela@17.153.39.199) has joined #rme-server
2013-09-18 14:36:42	aubrey	EC: I know that there's a change in compass compared to master as to how grid items are handled
2013-09-18 14:37:08	aubrey	I'm not sure of any other changes that we need to account for
2013-09-18 14:38:03	greggroth	I recall being pinged on a few cards -- let me see if I can find them
2013-09-18 14:38:10	@EC	Thanks
2013-09-18 14:38:37	@EC	Trying to identify what we need and what we don’t so we can extract them into a mavericks branch
2013-09-18 14:41:49	greggroth	we added sorting by author for files
2013-09-18 14:44:17	@EC	A new feature?
2013-09-18 14:45:11	@EC	Was that for Compass or Mavericks compatibility?
2013-09-18 14:45:28	aubrey	That was a story from the Mavericks project
2013-09-18 14:46:02	greggroth	yes -- https://code.apple.com/RetailSoftwareEngineering/intersect/pull/751
2013-09-18 14:46:36	greggroth	I added a hook to save the author's name in a field so files could be sorted by that field
2013-09-18 14:51:35	aubrey	https://code.apple.com/RetailSoftwareEngineering/intersect/pull/747 was also from the mavericks project: https://greenhopper.apple.com/browse/OSVII-1479
2013-09-18 14:58:41	@EC	This is good
2013-09-18 14:58:42	@EC	This is what I need
2013-09-18 14:58:43	@EC	Any more?
2013-09-18 14:59:56	greggroth	I believe that's it
2013-09-18 15:00:12	aubrey	yeah, I don't see anything else that looks applicable in the compass commits
2013-09-18 15:00:30	@EC	What about grid item representation changes
2013-09-18 15:00:37	@EC	That’s the one I keep hearing about
2013-09-18 15:00:45	@EC	Apparently we asked them to change the nesting level for Compass?
2013-09-18 15:01:35	@EC	Because the client builds are backports of a lot of Compass work that change is now inextricably linked with the Mavericks project
2013-09-18 15:02:26	aubrey	yes, grid item content attributes are now nested under a "content" attribute
2013-09-18 15:02:48	@EC	What story/pull/commit do I need for that?
2013-09-18 15:02:48	aubrey	do the mavericks clients expect the new grid item schema?
2013-09-18 15:02:57	@EC	Yes, unfortunately
2013-09-18 15:03:19	@EC	They needed to pull back some changes from the Compass branch to solve some Mavericks issues
2013-09-18 15:03:24	@EC	Like one-doc-one-moc
2013-09-18 15:03:35	@EC	That change was too intertwined to separate
2013-09-18 15:03:40	@EC	And came with those
2013-09-18 15:04:51	aubrey	that may be more hairy to pull those commits out, it was changed a while back and then a lot of the commits that were pulled in from rebases onto master had to be updated to account for the new grid item schema
2013-09-18 15:05:36	@EC	Well…either we will have to or they will
2013-09-18 15:05:47	@EC	Or we need to come up with additional alternatives
2013-09-18 15:06:07	@EC	Any place I could start at just to understand the change better?
2013-09-18 15:06:23	aubrey	I'm looking for it now
2013-09-18 15:06:27	@EC	Thanks
2013-09-18 15:14:33	@EC	greggroth: FYI – I restored one of your deleted branches on code.apple.com
2013-09-18 15:15:26	aubrey	here's the original PR for the change to grid items: https://code.apple.com/RetailSoftwareEngineering/intersect/pull/485
2013-09-18 15:15:37	@EC	Thank you
2013-09-18 15:27:36	aubrey	EC: I've heard one-doc-one-moc thrown around a couple of times but I don't know if I was on the project when it was first explained. What do you mean by that?

2013-09-18 16:02:10	@EC	It’s shorthand for one-document-one-managed-object-context
2013-09-18 16:02:32	@EC	Enables RetailMe Mac to keep track of changes to an individual document
2013-09-18 16:02:46	@EC	So a dirty-state can be tracked on a per-document basis
2013-09-18 16:02:49	@EC	Rather than globally
2013-09-18 16:03:00	@EC	Does more than that but that’s one of the big benefits
2013-09-18 16:03:29	aubrey	ah ok, that makes sense
2013-09-18 16:03:36	@EC	https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/DataManagement/Devpedia-CoreData/managedObjectContext.html
2013-09-18 16:04:12	@EC	And all the work for one-doc-one-moc was done before Compass, then thrown into Compass thinking “We’ll just release it as part of that”
2013-09-18 16:04:16	@EC	Mistake
2013-09-18 16:08:27	@EC	By the way, does everyone here know that Kenny has left our team?
2013-09-18 16:08:35	@EC	Just realized you may not have that info.
2013-09-18 16:09:16	aubrey	Ah no, I don't think we knew that
2013-09-18 16:09:20	greggroth	I didn't know that.  Thanks for the heads up.
2013-09-18 16:09:29	@EC	So that happened
2013-09-18 16:09:56	greggroth	was he the one who always yells about ants on the calls?
2013-09-18 16:10:09	@EC	He is now making the software that runs your iPhones. So you can never trust your phone again.
2013-09-18 16:10:21	@EC	greggroth: One of ‘em
2013-09-18 16:10:35	@EC	He was our client lead
2013-09-18 16:10:50	greggroth	Ok -- who's replacing him?
2013-09-18 16:10:57	@EC	Barry and Chris Purcell
2013-09-18 16:11:05	@EC	Barry’s been covering iOS for awhile
2013-09-18 16:11:10	@EC	Chris has been working on Mac for awhile
2013-09-18 16:11:18	@EC	So they’re just going to continue that
2013-09-18 16:11:42	@EC	Previously, Kenny covered both and guided Chris and Barry
2013-09-18 16:11:57	greggroth	ok
2013-09-18 16:26:00	@EC	greggroth: Mavericks compatibility is going to be released long before Compass is
2013-09-18 16:26:16	@EC	To support that, would you mind rebasing your file-sort branch off master?
2013-09-18 16:26:29	@EC	It looks like it is backwards-compatible, right?
2013-09-18 16:26:35	@EC	I.e. should work fine in production today?
2013-09-18 16:26:54	greggroth	ok

2013-09-18 16:27:08	@EC	Am I correct about backwards-compatibility?
2013-09-18 16:28:09	greggroth	I believe so.
2013-09-18 16:28:20	@EC	k
2013-09-18 16:28:35	@EC	Let’s base it off master and merge it into next-release then
2013-09-18 16:28:43	@EC	We’ll get it out ahead of Mavericks
2013-09-18 16:42:34	greggroth	EC:  https://code.apple.com/RetailSoftwareEngineering/intersect/tree/greggroth/compass-file-sorting
2013-09-18 16:42:52	greggroth	I created a new branch that's based on master
2013-09-18 16:43:14	greggroth	I'm running the tests now
2013-09-18 16:45:19	@EC	Thanks
2013-09-18 16:45:29	@EC	I was able to rebase 747 cleany
2013-09-18 16:45:31	@EC	cleanly
2013-09-18 16:45:35	@EC	Running those tests now
2013-09-18 16:47:29	@EC	So important to note: if you guys are asked to make server changes as part of the iOS 7/Mavericks project
2013-09-18 16:48:02	@EC	We need to help the requestor determine if this is a change that should be applied in production today
2013-09-18 16:48:26	@EC	Or will need to be deployed synchronously with the Mavericks build of Mac
2013-09-18 16:49:03	@EC	If it’s a backwards-compatible change (works with the currently-released Mac) target next-release
2013-09-18 16:49:13	@EC	If it’s needed for Mavericks and must be deployed synchronously
2013-09-18 16:49:23	@EC	First, that should raise a red flag and we should analyze further
2013-09-18 16:49:34	@EC	But second, that may need to go into a new “mavericks” branch
2013-09-18 16:49:49	greggroth	:+1:
2013-09-18 16:50:05	@EC	Most likely, any iOS7/Mavericks changes should not target compass
2013-09-18 16:50:25	@EC	I’m not sure anyone from the client or QA team is paying a lot of attention to that right now
2013-09-18 16:50:29	@EC	So we’ll need to

2013-09-19 15:30:14	greggroth	EC  Have you thought of more for us to work on?  If not, we can work on moving everything to serializers.
2013-09-19 15:31:12	@EC	I could use help figuring out how to backport this content-nesting change for the Mavericks compatibility project
2013-09-19 15:31:52	greggroth	ok -- is there anything in particular I can do to help?
2013-09-19 15:32:21	@EC	Identify what we need to do :)
2013-09-19 15:32:39	@EC	So what I know right now
2013-09-19 15:32:57	greggroth	sounds good.  I'll see what I can do.
2013-09-19 15:33:08	@EC	Is that the Mavericks build of Mac will have the content attributes nested under “content”
2013-09-19 15:33:21	@EC	Whereas in production today I think they are individual top-level attributes
2013-09-19 15:33:40	@EC	As I understand it, they made that change in response to our request during Compass refactoring
2013-09-19 15:33:49	@EC	Aubrey pointed me here yesterday: https://code.apple.com/RetailSoftwareEngineering/intersect/pull/485
2013-09-19 15:33:55	@EC	Which is a big changeset
2013-09-19 15:34:27	@EC	We need to figure out some way to support that change in the client-server content-attributes nesting level
2013-09-19 15:34:51	@EC	And make sure it is backwards compatible or we will have to synchronize releases
2013-09-19 15:35:12	@EC	Which preferably we won’t
2013-09-19 15:35:34	@EC	Let me just check in with Harmann and make sure I’m correct about the problem
2013-09-19 15:36:32	greggroth	:+1:   I'm not sure I completely understand the problem either, but it'd be good to hear about it when you hear from harmann
2013-09-19 15:39:22	@EC	I think this problem is likely a great example of why we need to decouple client-server representations from internal server representations
2013-09-19 15:39:46	@EC	Started reviewing your work on that, aubrey, to see if it might be helpful here
2013-09-19 15:39:53	@EC	Literally just started
2013-09-19 15:40:49	aubrey	There's definitely room for improvement on that branch, but your feedback would be great
2013-09-19 15:45:32	@EC	Sent Harmann a text
2013-09-19 15:55:28	@EC	This backporting raises concerns for me around the accuracy of our QA testing
2013-09-19 15:55:54	@EC	If the server code was in “compass” what was QA testing against?
2013-09-19 15:56:06	@EC	And if it wasn’t “compass” how did it pass?
2013-09-19 15:56:17	@EC	If it was “compass” how did RetailMe Mac work properly?
2013-09-19 16:00:28	@EC	greggroth: Looks like Harmann is on a plane. Here’s the issue as I understand it:
2013-09-19 16:01:09	@EC	In production today, RetailMe Mac send a JSON representation of a grid item with style-specific attributes as top-level attributes (peers with all other grid item attributes).
2013-09-19 16:01:38	@EC	The Mavericks-compatible, non-Compass version of Mac will nest style-specific attributes under a new “content” attribute.
2013-09-19 16:02:09	aubrey	Here's the PR for the backport of 747, all the tests are green on this: https://code.apple.com/RetailSoftwareEngineering/intersect/pull/773
2013-09-19 16:02:12	@EC	For example, “caption”, “zoomable”, “images”, “style”, “pixel_size”, etc.
2013-09-19 16:02:33	@EC	I’m going to fire up RetailMe Mac and confirm that’s how both builds are working
2013-09-19 16:03:01	-->	pamela (~pwnela@17.153.39.80) has joined #rme-server
2013-09-19 16:03:02	@EC	The question then becomes what changes should we make to the server as it is today to accommodate that change in Mac
2013-09-19 16:35:32	@EC	greggroth: That is exactly what it does
2013-09-19 16:35:47	@EC	Diff the representations I’m sending you
2013-09-19 16:36:05	@EC	They are for an article and a lesson in both the master Mac build and Mavericks Mac build
2013-09-19 16:46:07	greggroth	looking at them now
2013-09-19 16:53:24	greggroth	The article json doesn't appear to use the `content` attribute
2013-09-19 16:53:30	greggroth	but lessons do.
2013-09-19 16:58:52	greggroth	EC ^
2013-09-19 17:00:40	@EC	Correct.
2013-09-19 17:01:04	@EC	What was originally Creator::GridItem became Creator::ArticleGridItem during the training project
2013-09-19 17:01:11	@EC	And a new Creator::GridItem was created
2013-09-19 17:01:16	@EC	First used in lessons
2013-09-19 17:01:45	@EC	It appears server-side we only changed the nesting for Creator::GridItems
2013-09-19 17:03:35	aubrey	looking at the features, that's the schema we're using in compass for article grid items so it looks like it matches up with compass in both cases
2013-09-19 17:04:03	greggroth	ah right
2013-09-19 17:07:11	@EC	I pointed out to QA that their Mavericks testing should be failing right now
2013-09-19 17:07:48	@EC	Good time to note that QA is an extra set of eyes, not a safety net
2013-09-19 17:24:01	@EC	greggroth: Think you have a handle on the grid-item-content backport? If so, I’ll move on to reviewing your recent emails and PRs
2013-09-19 17:30:40	aubrey	yeah we're pairing on that now
2013-09-19 17:36:49	@EC	k
2013-09-19 17:37:34	@EC	Keep in mind that a backwards-compatible solution is ideal. (Supports old Mac clients and Mac Mavericks clients).
2013-09-19 17:37:56	@EC	If we can’t achieve that we have to deal with synchronized releases and support issues from content creators who don’t immediately upgrade.
2013-09-19 17:38:27	@EC	If we can achieve that we can deploy the solution next week and forget about it.

2013-09-19 17:46:59	greggroth	EC  If we try to support both request body schemas, how will we know which schema the client supports?
2013-09-19 17:48:36	@EC	Great observation
2013-09-19 17:48:59	@EC	Two things come to mind as possibilities
2013-09-19 17:49:20	@EC	One is use the inbound representation to determine which outbound representation to return
2013-09-19 17:49:27	@EC	Could be done by an intermediate 
2013-09-19 17:49:37	greggroth	I can't take all the credit -- aubrey thought of it right after he closed his computer.  :-)
2013-09-19 17:49:52	@EC	Alternatively, could reflect the content attributes in two places
2013-09-19 17:49:59	@EC	top-level and “contents”
2013-09-19 17:50:15	@EC	Those are just sparks
2013-09-19 17:50:22	@EC	I haven’t thought about them critically
2013-09-19 17:51:14	@EC	My concern with the second is clients becoming expectant that the top-level attributes will remain after the transition 
2013-09-19 17:53:41	@EC	Well—we may not need to do a backwards-compatible solution if the affect an old Mac client would have against the updated server is negligible
2013-09-19 17:54:15	@EC	If you want to study the potential effects of that scenario (e.g. corrupted data, loss of data, etc.) we would have more information on which to base a decision
2013-09-19 17:54:22	@EC	*effect
2013-09-19 17:54:55	greggroth	ok -- At the moment I'm attempting to rebase pvanstee/grid_item_content onto a new branch off of next-release.

2013-10-03 15:57:36	gaffneyc	I don't believe it's root cause but may help with the issues.
2013-10-03 15:58:10	gaffneyc	Wont make any other changes for a couple days to see how it pans out
2013-10-03 15:58:56	gaffneyc	One thing I've been thinking about. If we had an exception service with an API we might be able to better correlate some of the information about the exceptions

2013-10-03 16:13:58	EC	So no reason. It would just be easier, yes?
2013-10-03 16:17:16	gaffneyc	It would be easier to correlate if we had an API to write code against

2013-10-23 15:42:00	@EC	gaffneyc: Thank you
2013-10-23 15:42:16	@EC	Has chef-client already run or should I run that?
2013-10-23 15:42:24	gaffneyc	I've run it, change is live
2013-10-23 15:42:59	gaffneyc	I'm just wondering if we should use 120s since we've used it in the past.
2013-10-23 15:44:06	gaffneyc	So the medium term change for chef is that git pushes get sent to the correct chef server once tests pass.
2013-10-23 15:44:26	gaffneyc	But... we're not close to that at the moment
2013-10-23 15:45:14	@EC	Ohhhhh

2013-10-24 16:24:47	@EC	greggroth, jonathanwallace: How is progress on grid item backporting?
2013-10-24 16:25:13	jonathanwallace	jay's writing up a bug report but we haven't been able to reproduce the bug he is reporting
2013-10-24 16:25:40	jonathanwallace	16:19:14        jay_tamboli | Can one of you please tell me what revision is currently deployed to dev4? I'm opening a bug report, and I'd like to make sure I
2013-10-24 16:25:42	jonathanwallace	                            | include that.
2013-10-24 16:25:44	jonathanwallace	16:20:06        jay_tamboli | In short, about 50% of the time when I'm editing a text grid item, adding a translation causes the global text to get cleared, and
2013-10-24 16:25:46	jonathanwallace	                            | then changing the global text causes the translation to be removed. I have a gist I'll link in the bug report.
2013-10-24 16:25:50	jonathanwallace	sounds like a not fun bug

2013-10-24 16:40:46	@EC	jonathanwallace: No, not at all.
2013-10-24 16:40:52	@EC	Okay.
2013-10-24 16:41:01	@EC	So we’re still in a problem-identification stage?
2013-10-24 16:45:46	jonathanwallace	EC: correct
2013-10-24 16:46:18	jonathanwallace	to see the issue intermittently is really strange
2013-10-24 16:46:45	jonathanwallace	is there some type of proxying that is occurring before it hits the app server
2013-10-24 16:47:15	jonathanwallace	i find it really hard to see the same request hitting the app server and it behaving differently half the time
2013-10-24 16:48:28	@EC	Do you know what URL he is accessing?
2013-10-24 16:48:32	gaffneyc	Scaramanga is slightly broken after some updates. Likely get it fixed tomorrow
2013-10-24 16:48:33	@EC	intersect.apple.com is a proxy
2013-10-24 16:51:46	jonathanwallace	i don't know yet

2013-10-28 16:53:47	jonathanwallace	all the reported server side issues should be rectified by the jjonathanwallace/OSVII-1578 branch
2013-10-28 16:54:09	jonathanwallace	however, that branch introduces another issue that i'm not sure how to address
2013-10-28 16:58:56	jonathanwallace	now that we're copying the content's translations to the grid item level (https://code.apple.com/RetailSoftwareEngineering/intersect/blob/jjonathanwallace/OSVII-1578/app/models/creator/grid_item.rb#L48), we now have translations in two locations in the JSON with the same id which causes unspecified behavior in the mavericks retailme-mac release
2013-10-28 16:59:51	jonathanwallace	we spoke with jay and it would introduce risk to add code to the client to handle this case which is only necessary due to the simultaneous release
2013-10-28 17:00:30	jonathanwallace	and we currently have no reliable way to determine which client is making a GET request for a lesson
2013-10-28 17:01:23	jonathanwallace	i know you were initially reticent to version the API but if there is a way to distinguish GET requests for the lesson for the mavericks client, then we can forego copying the translations and avoid this issue
2013-10-28 17:02:01	jonathanwallace	jay did a cursory examination and there seems to be one location on the client side to add a http header to distinguish mavericks from previous versions
2013-10-28 17:03:10	jonathanwallace	another option would be attempt to map clients versions to sessions but this idea falls apart rather quickly.
2013-10-28 17:03:25	jonathanwallace	what if a client makes a bunch of GET requests before ever POST|PUT
2013-10-28 17:05:49	jonathanwallace	we wouldn't know what format they needed so this option falls down
2013-10-28 17:10:28	@EC	jonathanwallace: Yeah, I feel like the code is getting more and more polluted and no problems are being resolved
2013-10-28 17:10:45	@EC	jonathanwallace: I actually think versioning the affected routes is a good idea
2013-10-28 17:11:10	@EC	jonathanwallace: We kind of did that for the search routes when we redesigned search in touch
2013-10-28 17:11:21	@EC	jonathanwallace: What I know is the current approach is not working well
2013-10-28 17:12:57	jonathanwallace	cool, any suggestions for how to implement the versioning? (since this is something we've done before?)
2013-10-28 17:14:29	jonathanwallace	also, when you say "versioning the affected routes", i'm assuming that the retailme-mac client will always send the version in the header but we only look at it for this specific request and only until 2.3.4 is no longer being used
2013-10-28 17:17:40	@EC	I mean in the route address itself
2013-10-28 17:17:47	@EC	Standby
2013-10-28 17:19:01	@EC	In search
2013-10-28 17:19:10	@EC	touch originally did GET    /search(.:format)
2013-10-28 17:19:36	@EC	When we redesigned it into a “unified” search control we put all the new logic on new routes
2013-10-28 17:19:45	@EC	GET    /search/u/global(.:format)
2013-10-28 17:19:53	@EC	The old client continued GETting /search
2013-10-28 17:20:02	@EC	While the new GOT /search/u/global
2013-10-28 17:20:30	@EC	Could do something similar here
2013-10-28 17:20:37	@EC	The existing Mac client would keep using the original address
2013-10-28 17:20:45	@EC	While the new client would start using the new address
2013-10-28 17:20:58	@EC	Then we can use two different views on each route
2013-10-28 17:22:04	@EC	Chew on that
2013-10-28 17:22:08	@EC	I have to prepare for a meeting
2013-10-28 17:22:16	@EC	Other alternatives welcome, too
2013-10-28 17:22:23	@EC	Anything but the track we’re on
2013-10-28 17:23:15	jonathanwallace	k
2013-10-28 17:23:20	greggroth	I like API versioning, but I think it makes more sense to use the accept header to version rather than the URI.  The resource is the same so the URI should be the same.  The client needs a different representation.
2013-10-28 17:24:25	jonathanwallace	i agree. i like the idea of leaving the resource URL alone
2013-10-28 17:26:04	jonathanwallace	here's a good example of that: http://freelancing-gods.com/posts/versioning_your_ap_is
2013-10-28 17:26:12	jonathanwallace	that => versioning via headers
2013-10-28 17:29:17	greggroth	nice link -- that's a nice solution
2013-10-28 17:31:32	jonathanwallace	k, i gotta run for a few hours

2013-11-11 10:49:11	laserlemon	EC: we still need to find some time to chat about sunsets
2013-11-11 10:49:51	@EC	laserlemon: How about now?
2013-11-11 10:50:21	laserlemon	sure. here?
2013-11-11 10:50:58	laserlemon	you expressed concern about how we're finding resources to alert of upcoming sunsets
2013-11-11 10:51:05	@EC	laserlemon: sure
2013-11-11 10:51:08	laserlemon	which is very much a concern
2013-11-11 10:51:30	laserlemon	but more importantly, the same process is used to find resources to *actually* sunset
2013-11-11 10:51:41	@EC	Yes. Specifically, checking the staged content’s state.
2013-11-11 10:51:49	laserlemon	correct
2013-11-11 10:52:13	laserlemon	what i think is the right way forward is to publish the sunrise and sunset along with the content
2013-11-11 10:53:18	laserlemon	in each of the published resource's translations
2013-11-11 10:53:56	@EC	laserlemon: I agree there are multiple places where this is a problem
2013-11-11 10:54:14	@EC	What is necessitating trying to correct them all at once?
2013-11-11 10:54:30	@EC	e.g. In https://code.apple.com/RetailSoftwareEngineering/intersect/commit/835d308793762755c5972270e9ed4333d3b97566 could we not just remove the call to #published?
2013-11-11 10:56:25	laserlemon	the issue is still that we're looking at staged content
2013-11-11 10:56:48	@EC	Except then you’re not looking at its state
2013-11-11 10:56:55	@EC	You’re looking at its controls
2013-11-11 10:57:11	laserlemon	if you publish a file with a sunset of tuesday, i would assume you'd want that published file to sunset on tuesday *no matter what* happens to the creator file after publication
2013-11-11 10:57:32	@EC	Correct. Unless the sunset is changed.
2013-11-11 10:57:40	laserlemon	there's the rub
2013-11-11 10:57:42	laserlemon	is it…
2013-11-11 10:57:50	laserlemon	"unless the sunset is changed"
2013-11-11 10:57:50	laserlemon	or
2013-11-11 10:58:01	laserlemon	"unless the sunset is changed *and* the file is republished"
2013-11-11 10:58:07	@EC	Unless the sunset is changed.
2013-11-11 10:58:30	@EC	There is only one publication schedule.
2013-11-11 10:58:41	@EC	But there can be more than one representation of the content: staged and published
2013-11-11 10:59:12	@EC	That is intentional to allow content creators to work on new revisions without having to do so live
2013-11-11 10:59:56	laserlemon	right. and i assumed that the same applied to sunsets
2013-11-11 11:00:06	laserlemon	that those could be tweaked without consequence (until publication)
2013-11-11 11:00:13	@EC	So like you said, if you set a file to sunset on Tuesday any published representation should sunset on Tuesday even if a newer representation has been staged but not published
2013-11-11 11:00:25	@EC	It’s an interesting idea
2013-11-11 11:00:31	@EC	And may help is in some of the other areas
2013-11-11 11:01:18	@EC	Does that simplify the problem, then?
2013-11-11 11:01:32	laserlemon	i'm not sure
2013-11-11 11:01:44	laserlemon	right now, i'm just trying to define the problem
2013-11-11 11:02:13	laserlemon	if the content creators already understand that changing the sunset (even without republishing) will affect already-published content
2013-11-11 11:02:36	laserlemon	then that's fine
2013-11-11 11:02:51	laserlemon	i didn't think there was an understanding of that behavior
2013-11-11 11:02:52	@EC	That is the current expected behavior
2013-11-11 11:03:18	@EC	Republishing applies to content, not scheduling
2013-11-11 11:03:33	@EC	It’s a way to indicate a revision is ready to go
2013-11-11 11:03:48	laserlemon	so then the problem is that we don't want to check for currently-published creator content when looking for resources to sunset/alert
2013-11-11 11:04:08	@EC	That is a problem, yes
2013-11-11 11:04:18	laserlemon	instead we want to look for creator resources that have previously been published
2013-11-11 11:04:26	@EC	We currently depend on the state of the staged content to identify what to sunset
2013-11-11 11:04:29	laserlemon	that is to say, they have published content that can actually be sunset
2013-11-11 11:04:37	@EC	Yes.
2013-11-11 11:04:46	@EC	That is not the problem we need to address now, though.
2013-11-11 11:05:01	laserlemon	what is?
2013-11-11 11:05:21	@EC	Identifying what to send notifications about
2013-11-11 11:05:31	@EC	Specifically, https://code.apple.com/RetailSoftwareEngineering/intersect/commit/835d308793762755c5972270e9ed4333d3b97566
2013-11-11 11:05:56	@EC	Although we have incorrect behavior in the app let’s not propagate it
2013-11-11 11:06:03	laserlemon	right
2013-11-11 11:06:07	@EC	Over time we need to shrink and remove it
2013-11-11 11:06:28	@EC	Sunset notifications need to be sent for any file scheduled to sunset in the next 14 days
2013-11-11 11:06:29	laserlemon	so if we fix this one instance, we'll be receiving alerts for resources that actually would *not* sunset as advertised
2013-11-11 11:06:42	@EC	But should
2013-11-11 11:06:45	laserlemon	yes
2013-11-11 11:06:56	@EC	If they don’t we’ll get a support ticket and can address that problem separately
2013-11-11 11:07:14	laserlemon	ok
2013-11-11 11:07:30	@EC	Basically, we want to write code to provide the expected behavior
2013-11-11 11:07:48	@EC	If another part of the system is inconsistent with the expected behavior we can address that independently
2013-11-11 11:08:07	laserlemon	the original story has been completed and is out of the sprint
2013-11-11 11:08:16	@EC	And you’re right, identifying what to remove is incorrectly done
2013-11-11 11:08:22	laserlemon	how should i track this work (if it indeed should be worked on in this sprint)
2013-11-11 11:08:37	@EC	Just a PR
2013-11-11 11:08:48	laserlemon	ok
2013-11-11 11:09:10	laserlemon	alright, i think i got a handle on it then

2013-12-03 11:35:16	jonathanwallace	EC: we have a question about releasing mavericks independently?
2013-12-03 11:35:32	@EC	Shoot
2013-12-03 11:35:54	jonathanwallace	greggroth and i were just discussing it and it sounds like we're going to cherry-pick the merge commits into a new branch based on master?
2013-12-03 11:36:00	@EC	Correct
2013-12-03 11:36:06	jonathanwallace	i.e., we're not going use next-release
2013-12-03 11:36:10	@EC	Correct
2013-12-03 11:36:18	jonathanwallace	is there concern about QA not having tested this particular release?
2013-12-03 11:36:19	@EC	The Mavericks-related items will be pulled out
2013-12-03 11:36:37	@EC	Not from me
2013-12-03 11:36:41	greggroth	QA's been testing on next-release, so we're concerned about missing something
2013-12-03 11:36:51	@EC	Anything in particular?
2013-12-03 11:37:16	jonathanwallace	our concern stems from the fact that we're manually reviewing merge commits and if we miss something, its unlikely the tests will reveal it
2013-12-03 11:37:26	@EC	The only other work in next-release right now is the virus scanner and Josh’s admin. portal work
2013-12-03 11:37:32	jonathanwallace	ah
2013-12-03 11:38:15	@EC	Take a look though the merges into next-release and see if there’s anything related to Mavericks you think needs to be included that’s not
2013-12-03 11:38:53	jonathanwallace	okay
2013-12-03 11:38:55	jonathanwallace	will do
2013-12-03 11:49:42	jonathanwallace	EC: looks good. two BNR devs agree that it looks good. :)
2013-12-03 11:50:02	@EC	Thank you!
2013-12-03 11:50:30	@EC	Any worries about inter-dependencies between the Mavericks work and other work?
2013-12-03 11:51:16	jonathanwallace	my first thought: the other work has been confined to the compass branch so no, not off the top of my head
2013-12-03 11:51:36	jonathanwallace	greggroth: ^
2013-12-03 11:52:11	@EC	I meant with other work in next-release
2013-12-03 11:53:55	jonathanwallace	no, i have no concerns about interdependencies between jproehl's work or the virus scanner
2013-12-03 11:55:24	@EC	👍
2013-12-03 11:55:56	@EC	Releasing Mavericks independently, early in the week to avoid two big changes at once on Thursday (virus scanner and grid item backport)
2013-12-03 11:56:25	@EC	Also, to get some testing of the server in before the Mac client is released (in case a rollback is needed)
2013-12-03 11:57:54	jonathanwallace	uh, i'm a tiny bit confused now
2013-12-03 11:59:40	jonathanwallace	to rephrase: you don't want to release the virus scanner and (grid item backport/mavericks) at the same time 
2013-12-03 11:59:42	jonathanwallace	is that correct?
2013-12-03 11:59:43	@EC	yes
2013-12-03 12:01:07	jonathanwallace	okay
2013-12-03 12:01:18	jonathanwallace	i'm clear now, thanks
2013-12-03 12:05:11	@EC	np
2013-12-03 12:05:17	@EC	Thanks for reviewing the list
2013-12-03 12:09:13	jonathanwallace	yw
2013-12-03 12:11:32	@EC	jonathanwallace: Is the new representation of training grid items in code only or does it affect the structure of a record in Mongo, as well?
2013-12-03 12:15:29	@EC	I.e. does it work with existing content?
2013-12-03 12:24:34	greggroth	It's only in the json sent to the client and doesn't affect data in the database
2013-12-03 12:24:56	@EC	Great
2013-12-03 12:24:57	@EC	Thank you

2013-12-03 12:33:53	gaffneyc	Listed somewhere? Sounds like 3.2.15 applied cleanly without test fixes

2013-12-16 10:10:51	@EC	gaffneyc: Okay!
2013-12-16 10:10:56	@EC	Let me know how it goes
2013-12-16 10:11:06	gaffneyc	EC: It's live. Went well. Everything is over SSL now.
2013-12-16 10:11:14	gaffneyc	There were 2 things that needed exceptions
2013-12-16 10:11:36	@EC	What were those
2013-12-16 10:11:50	gaffneyc	Updates (/iOS/retailme.apple.com/ios/)
2013-12-16 10:12:01	gaffneyc	DSAuth assets (/dsauth/)
2013-12-16 10:12:33	gaffneyc	Looks like updating touch doesn't send the auth cookie
2013-12-16 10:13:26	gaffneyc	Crap... and it looks like quicktime doesn't either
2013-12-16 10:13:34	gaffneyc	"GET /system/data/d84c21186e43ab1e2403782b2f84d4f4.m4v HTTP/1.1" 401 342 "-" "QuickTime/7.7.3 (qtver=7.7.3;cpu=IA32;os=Mac 10.9)"
2013-12-16 10:21:34	gaffneyc	EC: Disabling dsauth protection for now. Going to follow up with Barry on the issue with quicktime
2013-12-16 10:21:45	gaffneyc	At least everything is SSL now and that seems to be working fine
2013-12-16 10:21:57	@EC	Sounds good

2013-12-19 13:15:14	EC	laserlemon: hi!
2013-12-19 13:15:35	laserlemon	do you have time to help me figure out if something is a bug on the server or a bug on the client?
2013-12-19 13:15:43	EC	Sure
2013-12-19 13:15:45	EC	What’s the number
2013-12-19 13:15:47	laserlemon	https://dradis.apple.com/browse/RMEEHC-245
2013-12-19 13:15:59	laserlemon	explanation in the last comment
2013-12-19 13:16:03	EC	k
2013-12-19 13:16:47	EC	This is Notes::Controller, I assume? (pulling it up)
2013-12-19 13:17:01	laserlemon	yes
2013-12-19 13:17:24	laserlemon	the issue is really in the note model though
2013-12-19 13:17:31	laserlemon	general_json
2013-12-19 13:17:33	EC	Oh it’s one of *those* controllers
2013-12-19 13:18:28	laserlemon	as far as we see, the controller is fine
2013-12-19 13:18:41	EC	Do you have an example of the payload the client sends?
2013-12-19 13:18:57	EC	Are we actually letting them set a “notable_type” key?
2013-12-19 13:19:01	laserlemon	{"attributes"=>[{"title"=>"Page 4 - 2 Pathways My Job Module", "body"=>"Page 4 - 2 Pathways My Job Module", "page_number"=>"3", "id"=>"17581018", "notable_type"=>"materials_file", "notable_id"=>4461}], "action"=>"update", "controller"=>"notes", "id"=>"17581018"}
2013-12-19 13:19:03	laserlemon	yes
2013-12-19 13:19:05	EC	Oh lord
2013-12-19 13:19:27	EC	Oh…just
2013-12-19 13:19:38	EC	How did this ever work
2013-12-19 13:20:06	laserlemon	if they didn't pass the notable_type or notable_id, it probably would just work
2013-12-19 13:20:11	laserlemon	since this is just an update
2013-12-19 13:20:24	EC	Standby
2013-12-19 13:20:29	laserlemon	and during creation, the route is nested so that's how we identify the notable
2013-12-19 13:26:54	EC	Okay
2013-12-19 13:27:12	EC	So yes—it’s really both a client and server “bug”
2013-12-19 13:27:27	EC	But the root problem is that we’re exposing our STI attributes through the API
2013-12-19 13:27:37	laserlemon	yes, we kind of are
2013-12-19 13:27:40	EC	Because of what’s been built off that we can’t just remove them right now
2013-12-19 13:27:58	EC	So what if instead we use attribute whitelisting to prevent assignment of those on the way back in?
2013-12-19 13:28:02	laserlemon	i think we can get a quick win if we ignore those attrs on update
2013-12-19 13:28:03	laserlemon	yup
2013-12-19 13:28:06	laserlemon	exactly
2013-12-19 13:28:11	EC	Ok cool
2013-12-19 13:28:18	laserlemon	we'll tackle that
2013-12-19 13:28:26	laserlemon	thanks for taking a look
2013-12-19 13:28:46	EC	Should probably search the available routes and make sure there aren’t any general notes routes
2013-12-19 13:28:53	EC	Actually, that shouldn’t matter, should it
2013-12-19 13:28:58	EC	It’s probably fine
2013-12-19 13:29:03	EC	np
2013-12-19 13:29:05	EC	Thanks for checking
2013-12-19 14:08:18	laserlemon	EC: PR at https://code.apple.com/RetailSoftwareEngineering/intersect/pull/859

2013-12-19 14:10:13	laserlemon	could really use some insight from somebody who knows a bit more about lesson creation/publication

2014-01-03 09:36:00	laserlemon	EC: thanks. standing by
2014-01-03 09:36:15	EC	Finishing up a small script to illustrate the issue
2014-01-03 09:36:34	jonathanwallace	oh cool, thanks EC!
2014-01-03 09:36:47	EC	Looks like it will be a simple fix, too. Probably just switching to atomic operators in several places.
2014-01-03 09:39:49	jonathanwallace	sounds like this is all related to the published_page_ids field, right?
2014-01-03 09:45:42	EC	Yep
2014-01-03 09:45:50	EC	But there are probably multiple points of failure
2014-01-03 09:46:13	EC	Since it’s in publication this isn’t critical for the 14th
2014-01-03 09:46:33	EC	But I know the client devs. and QA testers would appreciate it if it was fixed sooner rather than later
2014-01-03 09:49:29	jonathanwallace	right
2014-01-03 09:57:17	jonathanwallace	EC: greggroth and i are investigating adding ability to run multiple resque workers to cukes (which is what i started working on this morning)
2014-01-03 09:59:41	EC	k

2014-01-03 10:00:04	EC	Well, not a true test case
2014-01-03 10:00:09	EC	But it shows the issue

2014-01-03 10:31:45	EC	Just received another issue report from Jonathan (QA), too. May triage his first.

2014-01-08 14:10:15	@EC	Starting to worry about the quantity of load-order issues arising
2014-01-08 14:10:27	@EC	Anyone have any guesses as to where these came from?
2014-01-08 14:10:34	@EC	Or could have come from?
2014-01-08 14:16:13	jonathanwallace	EC: are you able to consistently reproduce the load order issue?
2014-01-08 14:16:19	@EC	Yeah
2014-01-08 14:16:23	jonathanwallace	should that be the next highest priority issue?
2014-01-08 14:16:27	@EC	I see why this particular one is happening
2014-01-08 14:16:41	@EC	I’m more curious about the bigger picture
2014-01-08 14:16:59	@EC	Wondering: “was a load file removed somewhere?”
2014-01-08 14:17:29	@EC	Not sure about priority
2014-01-08 14:18:14	@EC	Keep your eyes peeled for a cause to rule them all, though

2014-01-08 14:21:33	@EC	Ah ha
2014-01-08 14:21:42	@EC	If config.cache_classes is true the issue occurs
2014-01-08 14:21:54	@EC	Nope, flip that
2014-01-08 14:21:54	@EC	If true the issue does not occur
2014-01-08 14:21:54	@EC	If false the issue occurs
2014-01-08 14:22:04	@EC	Preloading the classes is covering some bad load paths
2014-01-08 14:22:55	@EC	Something to watch out for: the large number of Creator classes where the class is defined as “Creator::*” instead of “module Creator; class *”
2014-01-08 14:23:09	@EC	Creator::* != Creator -> *

2014-01-08 14:23:29	jonathanwallace	?
2014-01-08 14:24:06	@EC	These are not equivalent: https://code.apple.com/gist/echaney/e5c16e962a390959e0c8
2014-01-08 14:24:19	@EC	One is a class named “Creator::Language” in the top-level namespace
2014-01-08 14:24:29	@EC	The other is a class named “Language” in the “Creator” namespace
2014-01-08 14:24:46	@EC	Unfortunately, that was not understood when most of the Creator namespace was created
2014-01-08 14:25:35	@EC	In at least this case, you guys have uncovered the issue by extracting shared behavior and trying to perform includes
2014-01-08 14:25:53	@EC	Take a look at the file for Creator::Language
2014-01-08 14:26:04	@EC	It tries to include the module “Creator::Mongoizeable”
2014-01-08 14:26:26	@EC	And (correctly) expects the Mongoizeable module will be looked up in the Creator namespace
2014-01-08 14:26:38	@EC	That would work if the class itself was in the Creator namesapce
2014-01-08 14:26:57	@EC	But not when the class is *named* Creator::Language and not in any namespace
2014-01-08 14:27:05	@EC	Make sense?

2014-01-09 12:19:07	@EC	jonathanwallace: Something that might be interesting is an indicator of the size our app
2014-01-09 12:19:13	@EC	Maybe number of models in the project?
2014-01-09 12:19:18	@EC	Or number of .rb files?
2014-01-09 12:19:36	pwnela	"a lot"
2014-01-09 12:19:37	@EC	Number of Git commits to-date?
2014-01-09 12:19:42	@EC	Heh yeah
2014-01-09 12:19:44	pwnela	"a whole lot"
2014-01-09 12:19:49	@EC	Apparently it’s a large app
2014-01-09 12:20:15	@EC	The other day I was looking at message_deliveries
2014-01-09 12:20:18	pwnela	I've given up renaming myself to "pamela" btw
2014-01-09 12:20:45	@EC	We’ve made about 140 million deliveries, I think
2014-01-09 12:20:55	pwnela	wow
2014-01-09 12:20:56	@EC	Stored in one table
2014-01-09 12:21:17	@EC	Size of the test suite may be an indicator of size, too
2014-01-09 12:21:29	@EC	What are we at—8,000 tests between the two suites?
2014-01-09 12:23:19	@EC	Yeah—about 140 million
2014-01-09 12:23:31	pwnela	"a whole lot"
2014-01-09 12:26:32	@EC	Chris has got a bunch of stats collecting in Graphite and a couple other systems
2014-01-09 12:26:47	@EC	They’re not very intuitive to me so I’m having trouble finding out much of interest
2014-01-09 12:27:31	@EC	There also aren’t good labels on these graphs
2014-01-09 12:28:23	@EC	Depending on what has been charted we may be doing about 1200 * 6 SELECTs per minute (or second—can’t tell)
2014-01-09 12:28:54	@EC	At least at our peak hours
2014-01-09 12:35:31	@EC	Here’s a ballpark on requests for you. I just tailed the load balancer log for 5 seconds.
2014-01-09 12:35:35	@EC	There were 92 requests.
2014-01-09 12:35:48	@EC	Could use that number to project out a ballpark by minute/hour/day/whatever
2014-01-09 12:36:02	@EC	Doesn’t account for fluctuations in peak but…
2014-01-09 12:36:57	@EC	pwnela: What’s the most interesting aspect of our app to you?
2014-01-09 12:37:16	pwnela	good question, let me think
2014-01-09 12:38:03	pwnela	definitely "interesting" is going from a mongo db to a mysql db
2014-01-09 12:38:23	@EC	Like in publishing?
2014-01-09 12:38:32	@EC	Producing a relational doc from a non-relational doc?
2014-01-09 12:38:46	pwnela	Yes
2014-01-09 12:39:07	pwnela	it's a little quirky :)
2014-01-09 12:39:59	@EC	An interesting number may be the number of combinations of language and country the API can provide
2014-01-09 12:40:19	@EC	And how each combination is produced dynamically at request time
2014-01-09 12:40:51	@EC	Can find the information to do that in config/initializers/globalize.rb
2014-01-09 12:40:54	pwnela	Are you looking for good stats for @jonathanwallace?
2014-01-09 12:40:58	@EC	Yeah
2014-01-09 12:41:02	pwnela	(I missed the start of this conversation.)
2014-01-09 12:41:03	pwnela	ah ha.
2014-01-09 12:41:19	@EC	I’ll stop there. Let me know if that helps you guys out.
2014-01-09 12:41:39	@EC	Sorry I couldn’t provide more scientific numbers. :)
2014-01-09 12:42:48	pwnela	I think those are great, make us look very impressive. ;)
2014-01-09 12:47:34	jonathanwallace	yeah, that helps
2014-01-09 12:47:36	jonathanwallace	thanks EC

2014-01-09 13:19:30	@EC	Anyone else having trouble running tests on compass?
2014-01-09 13:19:32	@EC	e.g. bundle exec rspec spec/config/app_access_rules_spec.rb
2014-01-09 13:23:46	@EC	pwnela: 9e6dc2 may have introduced something
2014-01-09 13:24:00	@EC	If I comment out the load_tasks directive in spec_helper rspec runs fine
2014-01-09 13:24:04	pwnela	That's what I was looking into...
2014-01-09 13:24:09	@EC	If I don’t I get some kind of namespace error
2014-01-09 13:24:16	@EC	Oh cool
2014-01-09 13:24:20	@EC	Were you able to reproduce?
2014-01-09 13:24:35	pwnela	Jonathan told me about it this morning, so I had a hunch it was what you were seeing
2014-01-09 13:25:13	@EC	👍
2014-01-09 13:25:21	@EC	I can workaround it easily
2014-01-09 13:25:56	pwnela	Oh, I thought he'd found a solution, but I think he just commented it out as well :(

2014-01-09 13:30:11	pwnela	So...I'll get started on that :)
