2012-12-17 10:41:27	zdennis	Morning greggroth 
2012-12-17 10:41:41	greggroth	good morning!
2012-12-17 10:42:12	greggroth	How's the weather where you're at?
2012-12-17 10:42:28	greggroth	in fact, where are you anyways?  :-)
2012-12-17 10:44:15	greggroth	It's chilly and rainy here in Atlanta
2012-12-17 10:47:41	zdennis	greggroth: I'm in Michigan, and it's been cold and rainy the past few days, although today it's not raining. 
2012-12-17 10:48:05	zdennis	By cold, it's been around 40 degrees. We don't have any snow (we're in the lower half of Michigan, in Grand Rapids), but northern Michigan does (where I'm actually from)
2012-12-17 10:48:16	greggroth	Are you with MartianCraft?
2012-12-17 10:48:24	zdennis	It's pretty atypical as it's normally about 10 degrees with a foot or two of snow.
2012-12-17 10:48:27	greggroth	*still learning where everyone's from*
2012-12-17 10:48:34	zdennis	No, I'm with Mutually Human Software

2012-12-17 15:26:32	zdennis	hey greggroth, can I hit you up with a question around the git workflow?
2012-12-17 15:26:58	greggroth	yep
2012-12-17 15:39:48	zdennis	greggroth: I've got a branch which conflicts with changes on next-release (a very small conflict). I have avoided rebasing next-release because that seems to defeat the purpose of allowing EC the ability to incorporate some topic branches and not others (if a problem is found during testing).
2012-12-17 15:40:09	zdennis	But that is an assumption I have -- the not rebasing topic branch. 
2012-12-17 15:40:24	zdennis	When I've talked to EC A few times in the past I've got slightly different answers, but I didn't realize it until recently.
2012-12-17 15:41:07	greggroth	is it possible to rebase next-release onto your branch and resolve the conflicts on your branch?
2012-12-17 15:44:07	zdennis	greggroth: so this where I think I am having a disconnect.  
2012-12-17 15:44:27	zdennis	When I've rebased --onto in the past it has still altered my topic branch in a way that seems similar to rebase. 
2012-12-17 15:45:36	greggroth	What I'm thinking is that while on your branch you run `git rebase next-release`.  That should replay your changes on top of next-release and let you resolve the conflicts in your commits.
2012-12-17 15:45:56	greggroth	so it doesn't rewrite the history of next-release
2012-12-17 15:46:03	greggroth	but puts your stuff on top.
2012-12-17 15:46:06	zdennis	right
2012-12-17 15:46:15	zdennis	but say that a merged topic 1234 which was in next-release is found to have bugs
2012-12-17 15:46:33	zdennis	so it's going to be excluded, by my latest topic 9876 is great
2012-12-17 15:46:50	zdennis	but 9876 has a copy of 1234 since it got rebased from next-release
2012-12-17 15:47:16	zdennis	Maybe it's a non-issue for how EC builds the releases
2012-12-17 15:47:31	greggroth	there should be a separate pull request to revert the changes made in 1234
2012-12-17 15:47:53	zdennis	ah ok
2012-12-17 15:48:24	zdennis	that makes sense
2012-12-17 15:49:29	zdennis	alright, with that, I'm going to rebase, and open a clean PR. 
2012-12-17 15:49:33	zdennis	thanks greggroth

2013-01-30 13:33:40	stevenharman	I'm not sure which, if any, of you are in the RubyGems IRC channel, but wow!
2013-01-30 13:33:44	stevenharman	DO NOT DEPLOY!
2013-01-30 13:34:01	stevenharman	So the gist is, someone used one of the recent exploits on RubyGems.org.
2013-01-30 13:34:19	stevenharman	upon recieving a pushed gem, RubyGems will execute parts of the gem to gather data and stuff.
2013-01-30 13:34:43	stevenharman	The attacker(s) exploited this by pushing a gem, that upon being executed, posted RubyGems.org's /initializers/* and /config/*. to Pastie.org
2013-01-30 13:34:55	stevenharman	So, the attackers potentially had access to all of the config, keys, usernames, passwords, etc use to run Rubygems itself.
2013-01-30 13:35:01	stevenharman	Luckily most of that stuff is stored in ENV vars. But they still may have gotten some of the keys.
2013-01-30 13:35:07	stevenharman	There is a concern that the attackers then uploaded new, and malicious, versions of gems directly to the S3 buckets.
2013-01-30 13:35:35	stevenharman	Per Nick (@qrush) of the RubyGems team:
2013-01-30 13:35:35	stevenharman	https://twitter.com/qrush/status/296685694087221248
2013-01-30 13:36:07	stevenharman	I've been tracking things all day in the #rubygems IRC channel, and I'll keep y'all abreast of any more news.
2013-01-30 13:40:01	zdennis	stevenharman: wow, that's crazy
2013-01-30 13:40:13	stevenharman	Indeed.
2013-01-30 13:45:07	stevenharman	Like I said, I'll be keeping an eye on it, but depending on exactly how we are doing deploys (are the Gems cached?) we need to be careful.

2013-01-30 15:04:26	stevenharman	mshafer: That only checks the manifest of the other gems to make sure the attackers didn't inject it into other gems.
2013-01-30 15:04:55	stevenharman	There are currently several folks funning sha512 checksums against the entire set of 300K gems to look for changes.
2013-01-30 15:05:05	stevenharman	Which still doesn't get us all the way back to full confidence.
2013-01-30 15:05:39	mshafer	stevenharman: ah, well hopefully they are able to get this sorted out somewhat quickly
2013-01-30 15:06:38	stevenharman	Currently trying to coordinate with Heroku to use them as a secondary source of old gems against which checksums can be run and compared to what is in RubyGems.org S3 bucket.
2013-01-30 15:07:26	stevenharman	Basically... its going to be a little while. And the plan for restoring full confidence is still being discussed.
2013-01-30 15:08:24	mshafer	yeah, RubyGems does have quite a few gems, so I imagine it'll take a decent amount of time to check everything

2013-01-30 15:22:39	zdennis	druibarra: are the QA environments manually deployed to or is that automated, do you know?
2013-01-30 15:23:25	druibarra	manually deployed i believe
2013-01-30 15:23:58	zdennis	there's work for RMEEH-350 that is ready for QA and John Bootle attempted to QA it, but he doesn't see the change yet (which makes sense since it's not out yet)
2013-01-30 15:24:41	druibarra	jesse is working on automating it
2013-01-30 15:25:25	zdennis	do you and EC have a schedule right now that you deploy to QA on? Just trying to identify if there's a way we can communicate better to the QA folks when we integrate work into next-release
2013-01-30 15:27:22	druibarra	no schedule at the moment
2013-01-30 15:27:30	zdennis	ok, could I request a deploy to QA1 (or could I ask when the next one might be so I can communicate to John on my card) ?
2013-01-30 15:36:06	druibarra	zdennis: the server team is not going to manage the deployments on QA. just let john know that the QA server needs updating and that he should coordinate with Jesse
2013-01-30 15:41:56	zdennis	ah ok
2013-01-30 15:42:10	zdennis	thanks druibarra 
2013-01-30 15:43:25	zdennis	druibarra: is that Jesse Badger or Jesse Grecco ?
2013-01-30 15:43:36	zdennis	I see two in JIRA, just curious which one it is
2013-01-30 15:43:40	druibarra	Jesse Grecco
2013-01-30 15:43:49	zdennis	thnx
2013-01-30 15:44:02	mshafer	If anyone is free to review something I made to clean up duplicated message deliveries that would be great, https://code.apple.com/gist/f85541d939e65de90ee6
2013-01-30 15:45:10	druibarra	zdennis also be aware that we shouldn't deploy bc there's a ruby gem update in master
2013-01-30 15:46:03	zdennis	druibarra: does QA deploy from next-release of master?
2013-01-30 15:46:11	zdennis	*or
2013-01-30 15:47:20	druibarra	i'm not sure
2013-01-30 15:48:43	druibarra	they can deploy from either it's up to them really
2013-01-30 15:49:13	zdennis	ah ok, i'll ask them to hold off updating and to wait to hear back
2013-01-30 15:49:23	zdennis	thanks for letting me ping you a bunch!

2013-01-30 16:15:33	@EC	stevenharman: Where did you first hear about the RubyGems breach?
2013-01-30 16:16:59	stevenharman	EC: Initially via @qrush
2013-01-30 16:17:46	stevenharman	He wasn't very specific, just mentioned that something was "up." So I jumped into the #rubygems IRC channel this morning.
2013-01-30 16:19:22	-->	jonathanwallace (~jonathanw@17.153.20.193) has joined #rme-server
2013-01-30 16:21:45	@EC	I haven’t found a great up-to-the-minute central news service for the Ruby community.
2013-01-30 16:24:55	stevenharman	EC: I think that's kind of hard, unless you want to stay atop Twitter?
2013-01-30 16:25:28	@EC	And subscribe to a variety of mailing lists
2013-01-30 16:25:38	@EC	It works but it takes time to collect
2013-01-30 16:26:17	@EC	What’s the word in RubyGems?
2013-01-30 16:26:18	stevenharman	I happen to know @qrush IRL, which is one of my rules for whether or not I follow someone on twitter, so it was mostly coincident.
2013-01-30 16:26:30	@EC	Lucky for us
2013-01-30 16:26:32	@EC	:)
2013-01-30 16:26:46	stevenharman	Current status is they have captured a memory dump to look at later.
2013-01-30 16:27:43	stevenharman	They are in the process of running SHA512 hashes against some assumed-good backups (from like 2 months ago) and comparing them to the versions hosted on RubyGems.org's S3 buckets.
2013-01-30 16:28:44	stevenharman	And there is also an a group of folks pulling all of the S3 logs and comparing the "PUT" times with those (when a gem was actually uploaded to the server) vs. the time that gem was supposedly pushed to RubyGems.org.
2013-01-30 16:29:22	stevenharman	Basically, S3 provides no way to change the modified time, so by comparing the PUTS to the modified times and the time that RubyGems recorded the gems being uploaded, they can look for "suspicious" gems.
2013-01-30 16:30:36	@EC	Sounds like deployment of Zach’s patch is happening tomorrow.
2013-01-30 16:30:59	@EC	I wanted to get that out early today so we would have the afternoon to respond to unexpected issues.
2013-01-30 16:31:28	@EC	I’ll get it integrated and onto the staging environment, though, for anyone who wants to test.
2013-01-30 16:31:46	stevenharman	at this time there is no evidence that anything other that the PoC gem (named "exploit") where actually malicious. And there is currently no evidence that any other gems were tampered with.
2013-01-30 16:32:19	stevenharman	The next step is getting new hardware up, and running RubyGems.org from there.
2013-01-30 16:32:43	stevenharman	That could take some time though. Until then all Gem pushes are disabled, but you can still pull (at your risk)... for now.
2013-01-30 16:33:23	zdennis	:*(
2013-01-30 16:33:27	stevenharman	So if you pull gems from RubyGems on deploy (which a lot of folks do) there is a risk that you're pulling tampered with gems.
2013-01-30 16:35:45	zdennis	Worse come to worse we could always generate SHAs of our local cached gem installations and then do a fresh project checkout/build and do the same there, and compare. Since the subsect of gems the app uses is so much smaller than all of rubygems
2013-01-30 16:37:04	zdennis	Of course, if they're able to determine in the near future if gems were tampered with, we wouldn't have to expend unnecessary energy/effort, but if it may take them several days it may be an avenue to consider
2013-01-30 16:45:02	@EC	Oh that’s an idea.
2013-01-30 16:45:13	@EC	Good thinking.

2013-01-30 17:36:51	@EC	Is it only used by AuditEntries?
2013-01-30 17:38:43	stevenharman	EC: My understanding is that it provides an adapter, or sorts, to allow safely storing those hashes in Mongo (by implementing the .to_mongo/.from_mongo protocol).
2013-01-30 17:38:52	stevenharman	s/or/of/
2013-01-30 17:39:05	stevenharman	s/or sorts/of sorts/
2013-01-30 17:56:30	stevenharman	FYI: sounds like the process of moving RubyGems to new hardware will be starting soon. I'd say don't expect to have reliable service nor confidence in any gems pulled from RubyGems until AT LEAST... a while.

2013-02-01 12:34:25	zdennis	EC: friendly reminder of question on RMEEH-62 and a smaller question on RMEEH-135.
2013-02-01 12:35:49	@EC	Heh.
2013-02-01 12:36:03	@EC	It’s in red in Things: “2 days overdue”
2013-02-01 12:36:14	@EC	Added 135

2013-02-01 12:37:38	@EC	To give everyone some insight into what’s happening…
2013-02-01 12:38:02	@EC	- We just finished getting all the security vulnerabilities closed. Patched app went out last night.
2013-02-01 12:38:13	@EC	- This week’s scheduled release just went out this morning.
2013-02-01 12:39:03	@EC	- Still recovering from IS&T turning on secure cookies unexpectedly this week. The QA testers and some iOS devs. currently cannot access the -train and -qa* environments as a result. Working with Gaffney to find a solution.
2013-02-01 12:39:38	@EC	My personal next-highest priority is to get some answers to vanstee and jonathanwallace on fallback chain behavior.
2013-02-01 12:40:39	vanstee	+1 for security patches
2013-02-01 12:40:40	@EC	IS&T is anxious to get a new load balancer configuration into production next week to replace our existing (vulnerable?) system. Following answers for Patrick and Jonathan I’ll be getting some answers to Chris on that.
2013-02-01 12:40:43	@EC	Right?
2013-02-01 12:41:04	@EC	After that is getting answers on 2.7 stuff.
2013-02-01 12:41:16	@EC	And that’s all probably more than will happen in a day.
2013-02-01 12:41:18	vanstee	EC: The fallback behavior can wait if you have other things to do. I still have bugs with the importer to fix.
2013-02-01 12:42:29	@EC	vanstee: No, I need to make time to get that to you. Could involve significant changes. Even if you can’t address it now I want you to have the information immediately so when you’re free you won’t be waiting on me. And so you plan and estimate well.
2013-02-01 12:42:41	vanstee	Sweet thanks!

2013-02-01 12:43:34	@EC	zdennis: That wasn’t to say “your two issues aren’t important”. Just wanted to let you know what else is going on that is preventing me from getting you answers quickly.
2013-02-01 12:44:07	@EC	Should be doing that more often.
2013-02-01 13:00:29	zdennis	EC: sounds good, i didn't think you meant that, i know you have a lot going on outside of my cards, just wanted to be proactive in communicating there was a need in case it lost visibility with everything going on
2013-02-01 13:04:01	zdennis	and kudos for getting the patched app out last night! That is a big win. 
2013-02-01 13:12:19	@EC	zdennis: ‘ppreciate the pro-action (word?). Helps me identify what’s the most pressing need for each of you when you do that.
2013-02-01 14:19:26	stevenharman	EC: I accidentally just did `git push origin -f`, meaning to type in the branch I was force-pushing.
2013-02-01 14:19:46	@EC	Wuh oh
2013-02-01 14:19:48	stevenharman	^C-ed it, but it git started pushing master and next-release before I could.
2013-02-01 14:20:02	stevenharman	Can you verify what SHA master and next-release SHOULD be.
2013-02-01 14:20:03	stevenharman	???
2013-02-01 14:20:03	@EC	Okay. Let’s see where we’re at
2013-02-01 14:20:28	@EC	Yes
2013-02-01 14:20:44	@EC	master is: fc0b4d2ba1f940d6bd1940df4c602ebe3ef84868
2013-02-01 14:20:52	@EC	next-release is same
2013-02-01 14:22:09	@EC	Looks like those pushes did take effect
2013-02-01 14:22:19	stevenharman	OK. I'll re-force push both master and next-release to be fc0b4d2ba1f940d6bd1940df4c602ebe3ef84868
2013-02-01 14:22:27	@EC	k
2013-02-01 14:22:37	zdennis	stevenharman: out of curiosity what's your push.default in git-config ?
2013-02-01 14:23:25	@EC	If you don’t specify a default in Git config. doesn’t it default to the currently checked out branch?
2013-02-01 14:24:34	zdennis	EC I think it defaults to matching which is "push all branches that have same names at both ends"
2013-02-01 14:24:48	zdennis	That is supposed to change, but I know that we've had to override it every time something sets up a box
2013-02-01 14:24:50	stevenharman	zdennis: Yes, you're right.
2013-02-01 14:24:56	stevenharman	That is changing in Git 2.0
2013-02-01 14:25:00	@EC	Whoa
2013-02-01 14:25:04	@EC	Didn’t realize that
2013-02-01 14:25:11	zdennis	it's the worst default ever
2013-02-01 14:25:15	@EC	Yeah
2013-02-01 14:25:26	@EC	So I’ll just go ahead and set my own default…
2013-02-01 14:25:30	@EC	Right now.
2013-02-01 14:25:38	zdennis	:)
2013-02-01 14:25:53	stevenharman	zdennis: The new default will be 'simple', I think
2013-02-01 14:26:20	@EC	stevenharman: Confirmed everything looks right again
2013-02-01 14:26:21	zdennis	that definitely seems more sensible as a default
2013-02-01 14:26:35	@EC	Thanks for getting it fixed quickly
2013-02-01 14:28:05	stevenharman	https://code.apple.com/gist/2267d2b74906bb2f6c4f
2013-02-01 14:28:12	stevenharman	That is was I saw fly by my terminal.
2013-02-01 14:28:42	vanstee	Been so close to accidentally doing that in the past
2013-02-01 14:29:07	zdennis	If they're going to put up a giant warning message, why didn't they just change the default and then tell people "this change dbecause it was unsafe. If you want old behavior… set … "
2013-02-01 14:30:37	zdennis	I feel that Mongo has is not letting me be my best self today. too much venting.
2013-02-01 14:30:58	vanstee	mongo--
2013-02-01 14:33:10	@EC	stevenharman: Yeah. That ctrl-c point is where that sinking feeling hits.
2013-02-01 14:33:32	@EC	It’s like cap deploy and then all the logs stop scrolling 
2013-02-01 14:37:59	stevenharman	Yeah...
2013-02-01 14:38:26	stevenharman	Luckily Git is one of the few piecies of software that I trust to not screw stuff up.
2013-02-01 14:38:33	stevenharman	So its easy to recover from that.
2013-02-01 15:30:33	stevenharman	When will GitHub Enterprise be upgraded to 11.10.300? We could use the TaskList feature for tracking all of the stuff we need to remove after we've done this import.
2013-02-01 16:05:07	@EC	Unknown. I could find out if it’s important.

2013-02-01 17:12:34	zdennis	I don't know if any one else has hit this, but the resque runner in RME-Server only makes one pass through each the queues it's working on. In cukes, this can cause you to have to run the "resque jobs" step multiple times. 
2013-02-01 17:13:40	zdennis	It seems like it should continuously work through the queues until a final run where no queues have jobs.

2013-02-11 13:33:11	vanstee	EC: Ugh, 3.0 is no longer supported. We're going to have to start patching rails :(
2013-02-11 13:33:33	gaffneyc	vanstee: Just started the process
2013-02-11 13:33:43	gaffneyc	They've update the 3-0-stable branch on github
2013-02-11 13:33:52	gaffneyc	Going to lock to that branch for now
2013-02-11 13:34:08	vanstee	gaffneyc: Yeah that's probably the best solution for now.
2013-02-11 13:34:38	vanstee	Still really sucks
2013-02-11 13:34:42	gaffneyc	Yeah
2013-02-11 13:34:49	gaffneyc	Also need to update json
2013-02-11 13:34:55	vanstee	Are there any thoughts on spending time to upgrade everything to 3.2?
2013-02-11 13:35:19	gaffneyc	Yeah, laser lemon and ErsatzRyan are starting on it today I think
2013-02-11 13:35:20	laserlemon	if we're talking intersect, yes
2013-02-11 13:35:25	laserlemon	that's right
2013-02-11 13:36:00	vanstee	Sweeeet!
2013-02-11 13:36:03	stevenharman	We had a partially-finished 3.2 upgrade that Will and vanstee were working on...
2013-02-11 13:36:07	stevenharman	but that was a while ago.
2013-02-11 13:36:15	vanstee	That was like 6 months ago...
2013-02-11 13:36:19	gaffneyc	Will's been off the project for 6 months now?
2013-02-11 13:36:43	gaffneyc	Don't envy anyone tasked with rebasing that work
2013-02-11 13:37:01	vanstee	I think starting from scratch would be better TBH
2013-02-11 13:37:42	vanstee	laserlemon & ErsatzRyan: If you guys run into anything really weird let me know. I got a decent bit of work done updating dependencies.
2013-02-11 13:38:06	ErsatzRyan	vanstee: will do. thanks
2013-02-11 13:38:18	vanstee	gaffneyc: Thanks for being on top of the security stuff. I'll upgrade breifing-room
2013-02-11 13:38:31	gaffneyc	:+1:
2013-02-11 13:49:38	gaffneyc	Why does debugger have to break every time we upgrade ruby?
2013-02-11 13:50:22	zdennis	gaffneyc: that's a great question, I've often thought that myself!
2013-02-11 13:51:08	gaffneyc	I think it has some config that matches patch version or something. Trying the latest version on 2.0 gives some error about not having a config

2013-02-11 14:12:34	mshafer	gaffneyc: its because debugger requires debugger-ruby_core_soruce which has the header files for specific versions of ruby, and it doesnt look like it has sources for ruby 2.0 yet
2013-02-11 14:13:30	gaffneyc	mshafer: Ah that makes sense. Is it just major versions (1.9.2, 1.9.3) or patch levels as well?
2013-02-11 14:14:12	mshafer	gaffneyc: it has major versions and their patch levels. Heres the repo https://github.com/cldwalker/debugger-ruby_core_source/tree/master/lib/debugger/ruby_core_source
2013-02-11 14:15:17	mshafer	it also looks like it knows about ruby 2.0 and can use headers you have but it doesn't come packaged with them yet

2013-02-11 14:31:20	gaffneyc	vanstee: thank you
2013-02-11 14:31:23	vanstee	np
2013-02-11 14:31:36	gaffneyc	We're looking at a few apps. Finishing the tests on intersect
2013-02-11 14:31:44	gaffneyc	Did you make sure json was updated as well?
2013-02-11 14:32:07	gaffneyc	They followed up saying that just updating rails may not update json
2013-02-11 14:34:33	vanstee	gaffneyc: Seemed to work for me with a normal `bundle update rails`: https://code.apple.com/RetailSoftwareEngineering/briefing-room/commit/d9408dd54a31ae414dd855b1826978200fcc86a2#L1R104
2013-02-11 14:35:02	gaffneyc	Awesome, thanks for double checking

2013-02-11 14:57:24	gaffneyc	Not sure if I should have used master or next-release, though it's based off master.
2013-02-11 14:57:30	gaffneyc	All tests are passing on my system
2013-02-11 15:00:25	zdennis	gaffneyc: if you need any one to pull that down and run the test suite from "other-guys-system-verification" I can do that shortly. My local poor man CI is about half-way thru a run.
2013-02-11 15:05:47	gaffneyc	zdennis: Yes, please.

2013-02-11 15:11:49	@EC	gaffneyc: Almost always master or, if you’re on a long-running project like training, a long-running “master”

2013-02-11 15:12:06	@EC	Makes it easy to combine features into a release then
2013-02-11 15:12:35	@EC	Versus something based off next-release where you would have to spend time pulling all the other features below it out
2013-02-11 15:13:08	@EC	gaffneyc, zdennis: Let me know when you’re all ready to go
2013-02-11 15:13:20	@EC	I’ve been in a meeting so I’m going to go read about these
2013-02-11 15:14:46	zdennis	EC: will do
2013-02-11 15:32:17	greggroth	I'm looking into reducing the number of callbacks and I'm noticing that there are a couple which create Creator::AuditEntry.  I saw zdennis touched that file recently, but otherwise it looks like not much work has been done on that part of the app.
2013-02-11 15:32:30	greggroth	is anyone familure with it's role?
2013-02-11 15:38:10	zdennis	greggroth: I am not very familiar with Creator::AuditEntry outside of resolving that issue with serializing custom objects to Mongo. You are looking for why it exists I presume?
2013-02-11 15:39:01	zdennis	gaffneyc: build has started… should have results in the next 30 - 60 windows.
2013-02-11 15:39:06	zdennis	*minutes
2013-02-11 15:39:18	zdennis	although I know a window guy if you need one. 
2013-02-11 15:39:18	gaffneyc	:+1:
2013-02-11 15:40:15	@EC	greggroth: Audit entries are used by the support and development team to see how a Creator document has changed over time
2013-02-11 15:40:36	@EC	They are used as clues as to how a user may have gotten themselves into a certain state
2013-02-11 15:40:45	@EC	For example
2013-02-11 15:40:58	@EC	A message arrives in retail employees’ messages stating the iPhone 6 is here
2013-02-11 15:41:02	@EC	When no iPhone 6 is announced
2013-02-11 15:41:27	@EC	And the content creator is “I didn’t send that message!! I set it to go live on x!!"
2013-02-11 15:41:42	@EC	And we look at the audit trail and say “Yeah but then James changed the date!”
2013-02-11 15:42:00	@EC	“Beat him up and take his lunch money!”
2013-02-11 15:45:42	greggroth	ah I see.  
2013-02-11 15:47:07	greggroth	re: RME-408/Mongomapper -- it looks like much of that is accomplished via before_save callbacks.
2013-02-11 15:47:12	@EC	greggroth: Does that answer your question or is there still ambiguity there?
2013-02-11 15:47:30	greggroth	it answers the question
2013-02-11 15:47:34	@EC	Cool
2013-02-11 15:47:42	@EC	Okay…
2013-02-11 15:47:48	@EC	Re: callbacks
2013-02-11 15:47:55	greggroth	i was kinda hoping the answer would have been "we don't use that anymore.  BURN IT"   ;-)
2013-02-11 15:48:01	@EC	When was that offending MongoMapper commit introduced?
2013-02-11 15:48:17	@EC	I thought it was in a version that was released after we started using MongoMapper?
2013-02-11 15:48:38	@EC	In which case are you sure those callbacks would be affected?
2013-02-11 15:48:43	greggroth	I don't believe that there was one offending commit, so much as it wasn't a bug until we had such a large document.
2013-02-11 15:49:07	@EC	v0.8.6 wasn’t affected, though, right?
2013-02-11 15:49:20	greggroth	oh i see what you mean.
2013-02-11 15:49:35	greggroth	yeah jonathanwallace has a branch where he downgraded
2013-02-11 15:50:37	greggroth	he said there are a few failures and I'm about to look into those since it sounds like reducing the callbacks isn't going to go easy
2013-02-11 15:51:08	@EC	That downgraded version presumably also had callbacks but not the problematic embedded callbacks feature, right?
2013-02-11 15:51:30	greggroth	that's my understanding
2013-02-11 15:51:50	greggroth	hopefully the failures on that branch aren't too nasty and can be easily resolved
2013-02-11 15:52:00	@EC	Could we just turn off embedded callbacks in the modern version, then?
2013-02-11 15:52:11	@EC	Keeping the standard callbacks?
2013-02-11 15:53:16	@EC	I’m not totally clear on what the feature introduced in MongoMapper was other than that it involved embedded documents and callbacks so you’ll have to excuse dumb questions here…
2013-02-11 15:54:41	gaffneyc	I believe the embedded callbacks stuff is a year or two old at this point. It was added before we started using MongoMapper and was part of the Rails 3.0 compatibility stuff I worked on with Ryckbost and Brandon Keepers way back when
2013-02-11 15:54:53	gaffneyc	Disabling embedded callbacks is relatively new
2013-02-11 15:54:59	gaffneyc	0.12 I think
2013-02-11 15:55:29	greggroth	we disable embedded callbacks in the migration since we don't need to update states/create audit logs/etc
2013-02-11 15:55:40	greggroth	but in normal operation, the application depends on them
2013-02-11 15:56:09	gaffneyc	If we're getting stack depth too deep on a document during migration it's likely we'll get the same outside of migrations
2013-02-11 15:56:41	greggroth	we disable embedded callbacks on migration to avoid the stack too deep exceptions
2013-02-11 15:56:56	@EC	So we literally can’t turn off embedded callbacks because the state machines on grid items would stop working, for instance?
2013-02-11 15:57:04	greggroth	right
2013-02-11 15:57:07	@EC	Fun
2013-02-11 15:57:11	greggroth	haha  yeah
2013-02-11 15:57:23	@EC	Well this ties in nicely with what I was thinking of asking you guys to focus on this week
2013-02-11 15:57:28	gaffneyc	Ruby's stack can go pretty deep, could we be causing some recursive check / validation?
2013-02-11 15:57:33	@EC	As prep. for Compass rather than setting off on Compass
2013-02-11 15:58:20	gaffneyc	Surprised no one has made a "a must go deeper" joke yet
2013-02-11 15:58:26	@EC	greggroth: ATM does everyone on Big Nerd have enough to do?
2013-02-11 15:59:03	stevenharman	I'm trying to track down all of the "undefined method `should_index?' for #<Class:0x00000004aeb5b0>" errors we're seeing in the training- logs.
2013-02-11 15:59:03	@EC	gaffneyc: Kenny’s busy with the new Postal Service track
2013-02-11 15:59:06	greggroth	stevenharman is working that `should_index?` bug and vanstee is working on locale-specific grid items
2013-02-11 15:59:22	vanstee	new_postal_service++
2013-02-11 15:59:24	greggroth	new Postal Service?!?
2013-02-11 15:59:24	stevenharman	oh yeah... I need to get that track!
2013-02-11 15:59:32	vanstee	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIJaQhVoMZg
2013-02-11 15:59:40	gaffneyc	EC: hah
2013-02-11 16:00:06	stevenharman	Current Status: Playing new Postal Service for the whole office!
2013-02-11 16:00:22	@EC	Okay. When do you think you guys will run out of work this week? Kurt’s pressuring me to get some stories written for you but it doesn’t seem like they will be needed soon.
2013-02-11 16:00:46	stevenharman	Stories for Compass?
2013-02-11 16:00:47	greggroth	Aren't we trying to wrap up by tomorrow?
2013-02-11 16:00:48	vanstee	EC: Right now I think we only have a day of work left
2013-02-11 16:00:58	@EC	vanstee: Perfect. Thanks.
2013-02-11 16:01:23	stevenharman	zdennis: I'm trying to figure out where all of the "undefined method `should_index?' for #<Class:0x00000004aeb5b0>" log messages are coming from.
2013-02-11 16:01:52	@EC	stevenharman: Compass is still not well defined. Instead of setting off on the half-baked ideas that have been tossed around I thought it would be a better investment to use this week to separate out translation from localization from publication
2013-02-11 16:02:09	stevenharman	There is no backtrace with them, but they are all over the logs. Often in huge batches. I'm looking through the related code and I see you extracted the Intersect::Searchable module not too long ago.
2013-02-11 16:02:16	@EC	Which, if Compass ends up going where it’s currently headed, would give us a better foundation for the Compass work
2013-02-11 16:02:22	stevenharman	Seems legit.
2013-02-11 16:03:06	stevenharman	vanstee: and I did a spike on pulling out publication a while ago. That rabbit hole gets deep and dark, quickly.
2013-02-11 16:03:08	gaffneyc	EC: Are we merging the training branch soon?
2013-02-11 16:03:17	zdennis	stevenharman: if there were backtraces it'd be no fun
2013-02-11 16:03:44	@EC	stevenharman: I’m not surprised. It’s pretty tightly coupled.
2013-02-11 16:04:04	@EC	stevenharman: I really don’t want to build yet another new product on top of it in a coupled state, though.
2013-02-11 16:04:09	stevenharman	zdennis: except I have no idea where its coming from.
2013-02-11 16:04:17	@EC	Each new project that uses it as-is couples it even tighter.
2013-02-11 16:04:18	stevenharman	EC++ on that.
2013-02-11 16:04:31	@EC	gaffneyc: That’s a big question mark right now.
2013-02-11 16:04:43	vanstee	EC: So here's a big question. Can we remove mongo from the creator side of things? I can give you a list of reasons if you don't agree.
2013-02-11 16:04:55	@EC	gaffneyc: Probably: no. Let’s plan to maintain it simultaneously for up to a month.
2013-02-11 16:05:04	gaffneyc	EC: Okay
2013-02-11 16:05:11	@EC	gaffneyc: The training team is wavering on when they want to launch.
2013-02-11 16:05:33	gaffneyc	EC: And training is so significant it can't be a soft launch?
2013-02-11 16:05:50	@EC	vanstee: If it won’t take too much of your time I am interested in understanding the benefits you’ve identified.
2013-02-11 16:05:56	gaffneyc	Guessing just based on what I've seen
2013-02-11 16:06:12	@EC	gaffneyc: No, it’s not. But not everyone understands that.
2013-02-11 16:06:19	gaffneyc	vanstee: As in removing mongo entirely?
2013-02-11 16:06:50	@EC	gaffneyc: And really the “hardest” impact is to the process the training team uses to design and create new lessons.
2013-02-11 16:07:19	vanstee	gaffneyc: At least removing it from the publication process (everything creator).
2013-02-11 16:07:52	gaffneyc	vanstee: Which is our main use for it (logging will go away at some point)
2013-02-11 16:08:08	gaffneyc	I really like mongo but I'm curious about the proposition
2013-02-11 16:09:23	gaffneyc	Replica sets are magical.
2013-02-11 16:09:56	gaffneyc	We've been investigating multi-datacenter support for disaster recovery. I have a good sense of what that looks like for Mongo but not for mysql
2013-02-11 16:10:10	gaffneyc	*insert comment about postgresql*
2013-02-11 16:10:45	jonathanwallace	heh, from what i remember when i last looked at multi-datacenter support, mysql > postgres but i've heard rumblings that postgres may have caught up in the interim
2013-02-11 16:11:39	zdennis	I'd back removing mongo where mongo doesn't clearly make sense. avoid unnecessary pain of mongo.
2013-02-11 16:11:57	 *	jonathanwallace that was circa 2009
2013-02-11 16:12:05	stevenharman	gaffneyc: I was going to make a joke about switching to PostgeSQL :)
2013-02-11 16:12:17	vanstee	gaffneyc: I'd be happy to talk about ops related database stuff another day :P
2013-02-11 16:12:22	stevenharman	It feels like, if anything, Mongo is on the wrong side.
2013-02-11 16:12:50	gaffneyc	At one point we were keeping all creator data to mongodb incase we had to segregate production / pre-production data
2013-02-11 16:12:51	stevenharman	Published things are really just big read-mostly documents that don't require any relational stuff.
2013-02-11 16:12:54	gaffneyc	Not sure if that is still needed
2013-02-11 16:13:58	gaffneyc	stevenharman: Mostly agree, though at the time key people knew mysql would handle the load but weren't sure about mongo
2013-02-11 16:14:31	stevenharman	So srsly... Postgres? :)
2013-02-11 16:14:32	gaffneyc	jonathanwallace: Yeah, I don't know the multi dc story for mysql or postgresql that well
2013-02-11 16:14:51	@EC	stevenharman: Additionally, a content creator and RetailMe Mac work with all the representations of a document at the same time. The end-user only needs one of them.
2013-02-11 16:15:12	gaffneyc	But I do know postgres has a replication mode where it can replicate over spotty connections (like phone in once a day)
2013-02-11 16:15:44	vanstee	gaffneyc: Check out mmm (http://mysql-mmm.org)
2013-02-11 16:15:48	gaffneyc	We've talked about postgresql before but it's a much bigger topic than "oh this would be cool"
2013-02-11 16:15:59	gaffneyc	vanstee: Yeah, I've looked at that. It's… interesting
2013-02-11 16:16:10	stevenharman	gaffneyc: no doubt.
2013-02-11 16:16:27	zdennis	stevenharman: that anonymous class seems weird to show up in the places where should_index? is called
2013-02-11 16:16:33	vanstee	gaffneyc: I'm not a fan of sharding in general especially mongo's support via replica sets, but I'm weird about that kind of stuff
2013-02-11 16:16:38	gaffneyc	MMM is basically a set of perl scripts for doing some mysql wizardry. Seems more complex than it should be
2013-02-11 16:17:04	gaffneyc	vanstee: replica sets != sharding
2013-02-11 16:17:14	vanstee	I probably don't understand it correctly enough then
2013-02-11 16:17:28	gaffneyc	Replica sets offer automated failover on database issues. Sharding is it's own infrastructure
2013-02-11 16:17:35	stevenharman	zdennis: I think so too. From the places that I can see us calling should_index? it looks like we're always dealing with instances of class, not an anonymous Class object.
2013-02-11 16:17:52	gaffneyc	With a replica set we set it up so we have 3 servers. Those servers manage which one is the master
2013-02-11 16:18:03	gaffneyc	We can split reads between master and slaves
2013-02-11 16:18:20	gaffneyc	The mongo client then knows about the replica set and if (lets say) DB1 were to be shutdown it automatically switches to the new master
2013-02-11 16:18:33	gaffneyc	We have a couple seconds of down time but it's automatic
2013-02-11 16:18:50	gaffneyc	Whereas with mysql (and probably postgresql) we need to use other tools to get that
2013-02-11 16:19:26	gaffneyc	For example with Mysql we'd use something like pacemaker + corosync to move a virtual IP if the server goes down
2013-02-11 16:19:35	gaffneyc	But we have to do it on the network level
2013-02-11 16:20:02	gaffneyc	Alternatively we could use mysql_proxy to embed the smarts into a middleware piece (or pg_pool I think)
2013-02-11 16:20:24	stevenharman	EC: I'm suggesting creating a single document for every translation and localization.
2013-02-11 16:20:38	vanstee	Cool yeah I've used pacemaker with regular old mysql slaves to do something similar.
2013-02-11 16:21:07	stevenharman	Right now we do all of that work everytime something is read on the Training side. I'm suggesting that you could do all of that hard work just once (at publication time) and then it's just straight up reads.

2013-02-11 16:21:46	gaffneyc_	I've never used pacemaker before… but that's likely the route we'll go down.
2013-02-11 16:23:00	 *	stevenharman Is not sure I'm actually suggesting making the swtich TO mongo... just that it would make sense to me to do it that way.

2013-02-11 16:23:14	@EC	stevenharman: We’d probably have to get into it in detail to understand it. I suspect it’s not that simple.
2013-02-11 16:23:33	@EC	But it would be fun to consider.
2013-02-11 16:23:48	stevenharman	In fact... why store the training-side stuff at all?
2013-02-11 16:23:54	gaffneyc	Switching to a single data store would simplify some operations overhead
2013-02-11 16:24:09	stevenharman	Just build the document and then cache it.
2013-02-11 16:24:12	gaffneyc	Though fortunately we haven't had any data issues yet
2013-02-11 16:24:57	stevenharman	so build on demand, and then serve from a cache. On re-publish, eject it from the cache. On sunset, eject it and stop generating it on demand.

2013-02-11 16:27:46	gaffneyc	I'd like to consider moving to elastic search at some point

2013-02-11 16:28:25	gaffneyc	risk? riak?
2013-02-11 16:28:43	stevenharman	EC: vanstee and I spent about a day on it the last time and go far enough to know we needed more time.
2013-02-11 16:28:46	gaffneyc	vanstee: You will know my wrath if you bring down a plague of erlang on me
2013-02-11 16:29:14	vanstee	gaffneyc: Being the ops guy I'm surprised to hear that. Riak is super easy to maintain. Erlang is a little goofy to deploy though.
2013-02-11 16:29:30	gaffneyc	I'm curious about elastic search because right now we don't have replication with solr
2013-02-11 16:29:40	gaffneyc	We'll have to rebuild the entire index if we have to fail over
2013-02-11 16:29:40	stevenharman	A week might be enough to make good progress on the Training stuff, at least.
2013-02-11 16:29:41	vanstee	Yeah elastic search would be a good move
2013-02-11 16:29:53	@EC	stevenharman: Does that mean you more time than a week? Or just that you knew you needed more than the day you spent?
2013-02-11 16:30:00	gaffneyc	Sunspot is a mess of a library.
2013-02-11 16:30:09	vanstee	Eeek. Don't tell alindeman :P
2013-02-11 16:30:22	gaffneyc	Rsolr / Sunspot has some bug that causes one 20MB document to take up 2GB of memroy
2013-02-11 16:30:23	stevenharman	that we'd need a good bit more than the day. We could see stuff starting to take shape, but we'd broken all kinds of stuff in the process.
2013-02-11 16:30:53	@EC	Okay
2013-02-11 16:30:57	stevenharman	We were mostly on an exploration mission - trying to see if any discrete sub-system, ideas, or processes emerged.
2013-02-11 16:30:59	gaffneyc	I've been working on a rsolr replacement on and off… but trying to integrate it with sunspot is hard since Sunspot is so tightly coupled to it
2013-02-11 16:31:00	stevenharman	And they started too.
2013-02-11 16:31:04	stevenharman	s/too/to/
2013-02-11 16:31:08	@EC	Got it
2013-02-11 16:31:36	@EC	If you had one week to refactor anything where would you spend it
2013-02-11 16:32:45	stevenharman	We had to do a lot of nasty data munging of the JSON for training. It is REALLY complicated and I'd love to tear that out.
2013-02-11 16:32:55	stevenharman	But that would require work from the client team too.
2013-02-11 16:33:06	@EC	Assume they’re not available
2013-02-11 16:34:08	@EC	Assume in one week you have to start implementing another Training
2013-02-11 16:34:19	@EC	What would you want to do to prepare
2013-02-11 16:34:25	zdennis	stevenharman: found it!
2013-02-11 16:35:04	stevenharman	In that case I'd want to work on de-tangling the publication stuff.
2013-02-11 16:35:46	vanstee	gaffneyc: Just planned a trip to Grand Rapids for the beginning of August. We should continue this db discussion then. :)
2013-02-11 16:36:07	stevenharman	And getting rid of the crazy way JSON is serialized would be nice to - maybe moving to something where we can use actual presenters - ActiveModel::Serializer, for instance.
2013-02-11 16:36:13	stevenharman	zdennis: go on....
2013-02-11 16:36:28	zdennis	stevenharman: it's that index_association on training::lesson is :courses. The indexing of associations assumes it can call .should_index? on whatever the index_association is, but that won't work on has_many associations
2013-02-11 16:36:36	gaffneyc	vanstee: Definitely! You should come check out the [i] headquarters as well
2013-02-11 16:36:46	@EC	stevenharman: Let’s plan on focusing on those two areas between the time all remaining Training work is closed and next Monday.
2013-02-11 16:36:56	zdennis	stevenharman: at least not as-is, I think it neds to be smart enough to handle collections
2013-02-11 16:38:04	vanstee	EC: Thanks for some time specifically allocated to rescue some stuff!
2013-02-11 16:38:08	zdennis	EC | gaffneyc: my build is done on the rails 3 update branch, all green
2013-02-11 16:39:15	@EC	vanstee: Welcome! Use it effectively. There’s pressure to start building *anything* to show work on Compass.
2013-02-11 16:39:30	@EC	So we probably do have only 5 days.
2013-02-11 16:39:38	vanstee	Good to know
2013-02-11 16:39:52	gaffneyc	Would love some eyes on: https://code.apple.com/RetailSoftwareEngineering/intersect/pull/388
2013-02-11 16:40:13	@EC	zdennis: Thank you. Will check it out now.
2013-02-11 16:40:20	gaffneyc	Need to get it integrated before we can address the ips.conf issue in chef
2013-02-11 16:41:14	@EC	vanstee, stevenharman: FYI – Kurt wants to track that refactor in Jira. He and I are meeting today to discuss my goals…which will be very high-level. I suggest expecting he will ask you guys to help him write more detailed stories/issues.
2013-02-11 16:43:52	stevenharman	EC: OK. I'd image we'll start with a time-boxed spike. During that we'll go spelunking and take notes of what things we want to address. I'm not sure how user-focused we can make these stories - and as an old XP'er, I'm not entirely convinced that technical stories owned by the team need to.

2013-02-11 16:46:38	@EC	I’d sum up the goal using: “As a developer I can add the translation subsystem without adding the localization or publication subsystem”, etc.
2013-02-11 16:47:09	@EC	Or even a little broader: “I can translate a document without publishing or localizing it”
2013-02-11 16:48:40	stevenharman	The value proposition is one of quality, speed, and sustainability.

2013-02-12 14:48:31	zdennis	gaffneyc: actually, would you mind if being a sound board for a moment?
2013-02-12 14:48:42	gaffneyc	zdennis: sure
2013-02-12 14:50:51	zdennis	gaffneyc: ACLs used to be saved however they were sent from the client. With the Rails security fix that broke empty collections and hashes, we updated it to enforce storage as ::Acl::AccessRule(s).  
2013-02-12 14:52:15	zdennis	gaffneyc: this worked except for how it treated the rule "any one can access". PR 392 makes an explicit Creator::AccessRule (which is wrapper around ::Acl::AccessRule)
2013-02-12 14:53:07	zdennis	gaffneyc:  this resolves the issue. Now, with the latest rails update we can go back to storing whatever the client sends, but it feels like making it more explicit as to what is stored and how it is serailized/de-serialized is a step in the right direction.
2013-02-12 14:53:45	zdennis	gaffneyc: although technically it's not needed. 
2013-02-12 14:53:57	gaffneyc	zdennis: Yeah, that does _feel_ better.
2013-02-12 14:54:49	gaffneyc	zdennis: i feel like we trust the client way more than we should
2013-02-12 14:55:02	gaffneyc	zdennis: Or at least used to, I'm not sure if that has changed at all
2013-02-12 14:55:07	zdennis	gaffneyc: yeah, that seems to be biting us a bit lately in other areas to
2013-02-12 14:55:37	gaffneyc	zdennis: I remember a case of "the client will NEVER send X". Except where there was a bug that all it sent was X and that crashed things
2013-02-12 14:55:44	zdennis	:)
2013-02-12 14:57:03	zdennis	gaffneyc: thanks for hearing me out and providing feedback.I think I'll leave PR 392 in place to get moving in the direction of making things more explicit. Hopefully some day, the clients and the server can rely on the same serialization format for access rules and we can get rid of Creator::AccessRule altogether (and just rely on ::Acl::AccessRule)
2013-02-12 14:57:50	zdennis	everyone: so disregard my earlier statements, and if any one has time, PR 390 and 392 could use some review and love. 
2013-02-12 15:56:57	vanstee	EC: If we have legacy lessons with a blank title and/or description what should we do with them (currently theres a validation for those fields to be present).

2013-02-13 14:08:38	stevenharman	zdennis: To pile on _even more_... I've made those changes we talked about and updated the PR: https://code.apple.com/RetailSoftwareEngineering/intersect/pull/390
2013-02-13 14:09:01	zdennis	stevenharman: thank you for the reminder, I saw that last night, but forgot about it this morning!
2013-02-13 14:09:12	stevenharman	Cool.
2013-02-13 14:09:13	zdennis	I need to fix a test and then I'll make that my next priority
2013-02-13 14:09:24	stevenharman	Like I said, I basically gutted the specs and started from zero.
2013-02-13 14:09:29	 *	zdennis nods
2013-02-13 14:09:38	zdennis	I'm excited about this change :)
2013-02-13 14:09:47	stevenharman	But I think it ended up pretty clean and concise.
2013-02-13 14:25:01	stevenharman	zdennis: Also, you need to edit your profile on the GitHub:Enterprise instance, set your "Gravatar email" so we can all see your face rather than an octocat siloutte.

2013-02-13 15:10:17	@EC	I’m sorry.
2013-02-13 15:10:25	@EC	You’re asking for Jesse Greco right?
2013-02-13 15:11:14	@EC	He (Jesse) is responsible for maintaining the QA servers.
2013-02-13 15:11:24	vanstee	Oh yeah sorry. So Dru would be able to handle deploying intersect to QA2?
2013-02-13 15:11:29	@EC	Though it’s the QA team’s responsibility to let him know when they need changes.
2013-02-13 15:12:07	@EC	He has the capability but only to support tasks like reloading the databases or taking care of things Jesse can’t do.
2013-02-13 15:12:31	vanstee	Let me rephrase. QA2 is running an old commit on QA2 who should I contact to deploy the training branch?
2013-02-13 15:12:36	@EC	We’re trying to route most things to Jesse for him to direct so that the QA team is aware of the state of their environments.
2013-02-13 15:12:49	@EC	Ideally, the QA tester you are working with.
2013-02-13 15:12:55	@EC	And they can work with Jesse to get what’s needed.
2013-02-13 15:13:04	vanstee	Ok thanks!
2013-02-13 15:13:10	@EC	That said, since almost all of them are brand new they may not know that.
2013-02-13 15:13:21	@EC	Let me know if you need help.
2013-02-13 15:15:33	vanstee	EC thanks. will do.
2013-02-13 15:18:33	vanstee	EC: Actually should we be assigning these stories to Jesse in the "Ready for Integration" slot?
2013-02-13 15:19:38	@EC	Hmmm
2013-02-13 15:19:46	@EC	I would imagine not
2013-02-13 15:20:13	vanstee	How would the QA guys know if a change has been integrated and deployed to their testing environment?
2013-02-13 15:20:15	@EC	The way we’ve been talking about the workload we’ve been trying to add as little to his responsibilities as possible
2013-02-13 15:20:30	@EC	Since he’s doubling as our build engineer in addition to being the QA frameworks engineer
2013-02-13 15:20:43	@EC	vanstee: Jesse would reply to their request for an update
2013-02-13 15:20:45	vanstee	Allowing us to also deploy to QA2 would work, or just deploying everything we push to Training that passes the CI builds
2013-02-13 15:20:53	@EC	It would
2013-02-13 15:21:13	@EC	However, the QA team asked for their own environments because they want to stay very aware of the state everything is in
2013-02-13 15:21:36	@EC	They have built up an automated testing suite which could throw false positives if other people are changing the data or code when they are not expecting it
2013-02-13 15:21:52	vanstee	Cool, totally makes sense.
2013-02-13 15:22:15	zdennis	vanstee: on a call last week we talked about a convention to comment on the card for Jesse, ie "Integrated in … <sha>". I don't know if that rippled outside our call
2013-02-13 15:22:16	vanstee	This has just been a recurring issue for us. Not sure where the root of the issue is.
2013-02-13 15:22:40	zdennis	We started to comment specifically on a few cards where the environment was out of date that the QA'er needs to get jesse to update the environment.
2013-02-13 15:22:42	vanstee	zdennis: That would work.
2013-02-13 15:23:07	@EC	vanstee: I think the root of the issue is that Jesse and I might be in agreement on a process but haven’t ensured it is communicated to everyone
2013-02-13 15:23:32	@EC	vanstee: I just emailed him to make sure we have the same idea. Then I will make sure all server developers and QA testers understand what’s expected of them.
2013-02-13 15:24:16	vanstee	Cool, I'll let everyone know on our end to leave comments with the SHA of the related commits.

2013-02-14 10:14:51	stevenharman	zdennis: I'm trying to fix that SQLite ordering issue. EC seems to care deeply about keeping SQLite compat.
2013-02-14 10:15:15	zdennis	stevenharman: oh good, you're here! I found another weird thing. I think we need to rename indexable
2013-02-14 10:15:58	zdennis	stevenharman: yeah, I know he uses it, that's why I often use it as my test dB so he doesn't flag test failures. Maybe we can persuade him later today
2013-02-14 10:16:39	stevenharman	What do you mean "rename indexable"?
2013-02-14 10:17:12	zdennis	stevenharman: just got commented, check your email
2013-02-14 10:17:14	stevenharman	And yes, I'd love to try pursuading him. He's rejected another story based on SQLite weirdness (only allows index names to be 64 char long, max.
2013-02-14 10:17:17	stevenharman	OK
2013-02-14 10:18:14	stevenharman	shoot. OK, I'll rename #indexable? on the association index thing.
2013-02-14 10:18:16	stevenharman	Thanks.
2013-02-14 10:39:21	stevenharman	I'm not sure if this is actually an issue with how Sqlite is returning those results, or if it's a matter of it NOT resetting the auto-increment id between test runs.
2013-02-14 10:39:59	stevenharman	zdennis: I'm referring to the issue you saw. It passes for me on the first run, but then fails every time after, with an increasinly large actual ID.
2013-02-14 10:40:53	zdennis	stevenharman: ah that could be, does that feature hard-code the expected id
2013-02-14 10:41:46	stevenharman	1st run: SUCCESS. 2nd: FAIL w/ID=10, 3rd: FAIL w/ID=19, 4th: FAIL w/28
2013-02-14 10:42:27	stevenharman	It does. I feel like we did that b/c we were orphaning old GridItems on re-publishing, rather than updating them.
2013-02-14 10:43:11	stevenharman	If I reset the state of the SQLite DB, it works on the first pass, again. And then starts to fail w/subsequent runs.

2013-02-14 10:48:03	zdennis	also, if you do care, i wonder if this would be a good example for stopping sqlite usage, because we're having to work around problems that don't really exist
2013-02-14 10:57:43	stevenharman	Honestly, I'm not sure. And the test doesn't make it very clear, in this case, either.
2013-02-14 10:58:23	stevenharman	I suppose we shouldn't care about the value of the id as we are testing the other values.

2013-02-14 11:12:43	zdennis	stevenharman: if there's a spec that covers publishing creator/lesson to training/lesson and one that covers generating the JSON for trianing/lesson, I'd be all for ignoring any dynamic details that we want to exist but don't specifically care about the value
2013-02-14 11:24:12	zdennis	stevenharman: do you want me to hold off on merging until that scenario runs in SQLite? Or do you mind if that gets addressed separately?
2013-02-14 11:27:39	stevenharman	Go ahead and merge and I'll submit a follow-up PR
2013-02-14 11:28:41	zdennis	stevenharman: did you push a rename yet of indexable?
2013-02-14 11:28:58	stevenharman	Crap. No. I've been confounded by this.
2013-02-14 11:29:07	stevenharman	Let me push that and THEN you can merge. :)
2013-02-14 11:29:47	zdennis	sounds good :)
2013-02-14 11:37:10	zdennis	mshafer: do you physically work near Jesse Greco?
2013-02-14 11:37:27	mshafer	zdennis: yes, he's a few cubes down
2013-02-14 11:38:06	mshafer	although no one really comes in before 9
2013-02-14 11:38:17	mshafer	im always the first one here at 7
2013-02-14 11:38:23	zdennis	dang, you are an early bird
2013-02-14 11:38:54	mshafer	i avoid most of the traffic and get a good parking spot
2013-02-14 11:39:52	stevenharman	zdennis: any ideas for a different name for #indexable?
2013-02-14 11:39:54	mshafer	plus since im still technically in retail while im up here its weird if i split my hours for the day up
2013-02-14 11:40:09	zdennis	stevenharman: is_really_good_at_indexing_guys_indexable? :)
2013-02-14 11:40:20	stevenharman	ZOMG, YES PLZ!
2013-02-14 11:40:39	mshafer	you should totally use that name
2013-02-14 11:41:19	stevenharman	zdennis: Here is the PR for fixing those tests. https://code.apple.com/RetailSoftwareEngineering/intersect/pull/398
2013-02-14 11:41:21	mshafer	we should just put everything under is_really_good_at_*
2013-02-14 11:41:33	stevenharman	I can get one of the other guys to check it out, if you're swamped.
2013-02-14 11:41:51	zdennis	stevenharman: indexable_for_searching? or search_indexable?
2013-02-14 11:42:07	stevenharman	#search_indexable? sounds OK.
2013-02-14 11:42:11	stevenharman	I'll go with that for now.
2013-02-14 11:42:17	zdennis	ok
2013-02-14 11:42:50	zdennis	stevenharman: I've got time to review, doing a bunch of test runs and reviews this morning anyhow,I'm in the zone!
2013-02-14 11:43:07	stevenharman	Nice. I was in that mode for like a week last Nov. :)
2013-02-14 11:43:30	stevenharman	I think there were a few days where I did nothing but review, run tests, merge.
2013-02-14 11:45:46	zdennis	stevenharman: i hope my comments aren't becoming to pedantic
2013-02-14 11:47:12	-->	druibarra (~druibarra@17.215.111.130) has joined #rme-server
2013-02-14 11:47:30	stevenharman	Not at all. I love thoughtful critique. I often fear I'm being too pedantic as well, so I'd wager we have a some-what shared aesthetic .
2013-02-14 11:48:21	stevenharman	OK, I pushed the rename too.
2013-02-14 11:48:24	stevenharman	Thanks again!
2013-02-14 11:52:00	zdennis	yw! i'll get those merged in shortly!
2013-02-14 12:15:22	stevenharman	zdennis: It doesn't look like `the response should have "steps/1/grid_items/0/id" set` will work as the step doesn't traverse the path.
2013-02-14 12:16:23	zdennis	stevenharman: blargy, i was hoping it did, the example I looked at was only using a single key
2013-02-14 12:16:56	stevenharman	I might be able to tweak the step to allow passing a key...
2013-02-14 12:16:59	stevenharman	I mean, a path.
2013-02-14 12:19:40	zdennis	stevenharman: it looks like that step is actually not working correctly now as-is
2013-02-14 12:20:43	stevenharman	I was thinking of changing it to:
2013-02-14 12:20:45	stevenharman	Then /the response should have "(.*)" set$/ do |field|
2013-02-14 12:20:45	stevenharman	  expect(json_value_at(json_results, path)).to be
2013-02-14 12:20:45	stevenharman	end
2013-02-14 12:21:07	stevenharman	oops... need to change field -> path
2013-02-14 12:21:12	stevenharman	but you get the idea...
2013-02-14 12:21:31	zdennis	yeah i like that
2013-02-14 12:24:41	###	zdennis is now known as zdennis|afk
2013-02-14 12:35:55	stevenharman	Ah, there is a big difference between `json_results` and `json_response`
2013-02-14 12:35:59	stevenharman	So I ended up with
2013-02-14 12:36:00	stevenharman	Then /the response should have "(.*)" set$/ do |path|
2013-02-14 12:36:00	stevenharman	  expect(json_value_at(json_response, path)).to be
2013-02-14 12:36:00	stevenharman	end
2013-02-14 12:36:39	stevenharman	Which is a little misleading, I suppose as you COULD set a value to nil, and that expectation would fail.
2013-02-14 12:36:41	stevenharman	Hmm...
2013-02-14 12:37:51	stevenharman	Though in that case maybe you should be saying `the response should have /some/path set to (value)`
2013-02-14 12:38:43	vanstee	stevenharman: Could you use `Then the JSON at "path" should be null` (stolen from json_spec docs)
2013-02-14 12:40:53	stevenharman	In this case I actually want it to NOT be nil. So what I've got there works.
2013-02-14 12:47:28	vanstee	d'oh oops
2013-02-14 12:47:30	stevenharman	zdennis|afk: I'm running the full spec suite now to make sure I didn't break anything with that change. However, I'm working from a cafe while we wait to pick our dog up from the doctor... and I'm nearly out of power.
2013-02-14 12:47:40	stevenharman	And I forgot to bring a power cord...
2013-02-14 12:47:50	stevenharman	so it might be later today before I push this stuff up.
2013-02-14 12:48:57	stevenharman	Actually, I just force-pushed it, but I won't know if we're green until later. :( Sorry.

2013-02-14 14:36:50	vanstee	Thanks for working on that. I remember inheriting some of that store importer code. Looks way better now.
2013-02-14 14:37:52	mshafer	vanstee: awesome thanks.  I've already made some changes you've suggested.  I'll make some more here in a few minutes
2013-02-14 14:38:24	vanstee	Yeah the main things I saw were just some railsy specific helpers that could clean things up. Overall design looks solid.

2013-02-15 15:00:10	mshafer	would something like that work there?

2013-02-15 15:00:34	mshafer	okay
2013-02-15 15:00:36	zdennis	you could get them sep like you have it "raise unless my_awesome_helper_method"
2013-02-15 15:00:47	zdennis	or you could combine… "ensure_my_awesome_helper_method"
2013-02-15 15:01:09	zdennis	They are both very good and communicative ways of doing it.

2013-02-15 15:02:37	mshafer	on a random note is anyone running bundler 1.2.4?
2013-02-15 15:03:17	zdennis	I'm on 1.2.3 atm
2013-02-15 15:03:30	mshafer	it tells me we should switch source :rubygems to source 'https://rubygems.org'
2013-02-15 15:04:16	zdennis	mshafer: i've made my first full pass. the changes you have are looking really good, let me know if you want me to peek again later. if not, know that you're doing really good work

2013-02-15 16:02:43	stevenharman	re: the SQLite issue you're seeing: https://code.apple.com/gist/9f15a73785619075761d
2013-02-15 16:03:49	stevenharman	That index `temp_index_altered_training_product_translations_on_training_product_id ` isn't actually created by us.
2013-02-15 16:04:30	stevenharman	Notice "temp" and "altered" in the index name (above) and the table name: `altered_training_product_translations `
2013-02-15 16:05:14	stevenharman	My guess is that this is related to how SQLite does the migration - adding/removing a column from the table.
2013-02-15 16:05:49	<--	druibarra (~druibarra@17.215.111.130) has quit (Quit: druibarra)
2013-02-15 16:11:40	@EC	stevenharman: Probably. But it results from some of the long table/column names we’ve chosen. The issue can be avoided by specifying an explicit (shorter) index name.
2013-02-15 16:23:18	stevenharman	I get that, but I'm not sure where this particular index is coming from.
2013-02-15 16:24:01	stevenharman	That is, we're actually removing a column and it looks like an associated index is trying to be removed, or changed as well.
2013-02-15 16:24:21	stevenharman	But it's not the index that we've specified in that migration.

2013-02-15 16:45:44	stevenharman	TL;DR: I think we can fix this instance, but unless we audit and ajust all existing index names, we will continue to hit this limitation going forward.
2013-02-15 16:46:09	stevenharman	Unless we want unreadable/random index name ;)
2013-02-15 16:50:04	@EC	10-4
2013-02-15 16:50:16	@EC	FYI: this week’s release introduces a new “required setting” 
2013-02-15 16:50:29	@EC	If you rebase and then your app won’t start up it might be because you need to set that
2013-02-15 16:52:09	stevenharman	EC: So I guess I'll fix this instance and we'll just have to deal going forward?
2013-02-15 16:52:47	stevenharman	re: required settings, you're talking about the email zdennis sent out earlier this week, yes?
2013-02-15 16:53:05	@EC	stevenharman: It’s not entirely clear to me what the problem is. I’ll probably need to spend a bit getting familiar with what you left in the comments.
2013-02-15 16:53:20	@EC	stevenharman: Ah! Probably. I didn’t know he had sent one. That’s great.
2013-02-15 16:54:35	stevenharman	EC: The original index name was long, but under 64 characters. So when the migration happened the temporary index name added "temp_" and "altered_" to the name, an additional 13 characters, puttin it onver the limit of 64.
2013-02-15 16:54:56	@EC	Makes sense
2013-02-15 16:55:20	stevenharman	I can fix that. But short of changing all of the existing index names manually, we're going to continue to hit this kind of issue during migrations. And every one will require a fix like I'm going to put in for this one.
2013-02-15 16:55:35	@EC	When you say “audit and adjust” index names do you specifically mean in the training branch?
2013-02-15 16:55:43	@EC	Got it
2013-02-15 16:55:57	stevenharman	everywhere.
2013-02-15 16:56:01	@EC	Yes, the idea would be to shorten all of the overly-long ones
2013-02-15 16:56:18	@EC	I know what you’re going to say next :)
2013-02-15 16:56:53	stevenharman	We can do that, but maybe we can make that a new card so we can close this one out as it will run everywhere but your machine?
2013-02-15 16:58:34	@EC	The goal is not to get it running on my machine. I have MySQL installed, too. The goal is to keep ourself compliant with more than one database. SQLite happens to provide a nice counterbalance because it is so simple and conservative.
2013-02-15 16:58:48	@EC	I would rather invest the time and effort to reach that goal now.
2013-02-15 16:59:05	@EC	If we let ourselves push it off to another card it is likely it will never get done.
2013-02-15 16:59:22	stevenharman	I'd rather invest time in using a real database (PostgreSQL, anyone). ;)
2013-02-15 16:59:45	stevenharman	So I'll start tracking down all of the "long" names and shortening them.
2013-02-15 16:59:59	stevenharman	What should "long" be?
2013-02-15 17:00:03	@EC	I’d also like the flexibility to change to Postgres at some point
2013-02-15 17:00:21	stevenharman	PG certainly allows index name > 64 characters! :)
2013-02-15 17:00:40	@EC	For now, I’d say keep trying to migrate using Sqlite until you can get all the way through successfully.
2013-02-15 17:00:42	stevenharman	51 is the max to allow the particular situation we're facing now.
2013-02-15 17:00:49	@EC	51 it is then
2013-02-15 17:01:17	stevenharman	So any indexs with names > 51 characters need shortened.
2013-02-15 17:01:27	@EC	Yes, please.
2013-02-15 17:01:30	stevenharman	OK.
2013-02-15 17:01:37	@EC	At least, indices not already in production.
2013-02-15 17:02:36	@EC	Let me get the release out and then let’s revisit the why behind this
2013-02-15 17:02:38	@EC	Sound good?
2013-02-15 17:02:57	stevenharman	Of course, those too will cause issues when we eventually add/remove a column from their tables.
2013-02-15 17:03:01	stevenharman	But yeah, sounds good.
2013-02-15 17:04:03	@EC	Maybe I’m not understanding something. Want to put the story on hold for a bit? I think I’ll be ready to go in depth in about an hour or less.
2013-02-15 17:07:21	stevenharman	Any indexes with names > 51 characters will hit this same issue if the table they are indexing gets a column removed. When that happens, SQLite makes a copy of the table, complete with indexes with the original names + "temp_" and "altered_". Presumably this is for efficiency or something, not sure.
2013-02-15 17:07:56	stevenharman	So if we have an index out there with a name with 51+ characters, if we remove a column from that table, we'll see this same issue.
2013-02-15 17:08:04	stevenharman	on SQLite. Make sense?
2013-02-15 17:09:14	@EC	Yep.
2013-02-15 17:09:17	stevenharman	Unless I'm really misunderstanding how SQLite works, and what the root cause of this is.
2013-02-15 17:09:36	@EC	I’m confused what the outstanding question is 
2013-02-15 17:09:39	@EC	Or if there is one
2013-02-15 17:10:05	vanstee	I guess a related more fundamental question is are migrations something that *need* to work in the development/testing env?
2013-02-15 17:10:37	stevenharman	Only if I should focus on JUST the migrations we need to run for Training, or in fixing any other indexes which may some day cause this problem (b/c their current names are too long).
2013-02-15 17:11:12	vanstee	Doesn't afford us any more support for switching to other databases in the future and really old matters for the database that we are currently using in production right?
2013-02-15 17:11:17	stevenharman	vanstee: I prefer them too, since it is like a built-in test of what is going to happen later.
2013-02-15 17:11:32	vanstee	stevenharman: Well as long as they work for mysql though
2013-02-15 17:11:40	stevenharman	sure.
2013-02-15 17:12:18	vanstee	I don't see any benefit of fixing migrations for the db we use only in development or testing enviornments.

2013-02-18 15:19:48	vanstee	Thought I had a question about bad legacy data, but let me look at it a little more before asking.
2013-02-18 15:23:19	vanstee	EC: Do we want fallbacks for empty translations?
2013-02-18 15:23:37	vanstee	There are legacy translations that have title and description set to nil
2013-02-18 15:24:03	vanstee	So a translation record exists (no fallback takes place) but the values are nil.
2013-02-18 15:25:07	@EC	Hm
2013-02-18 15:25:21	@EC	Can you outline the real example for me?
2013-02-18 15:25:50	vanstee	Yeah let me even give you the ID's of records I'm looking at
2013-02-18 15:34:05	vanstee	EC: So when we try to import records like Training::Lesson ID=27 with a translation record that has title and description set to nil (locale 'en-CH'), should we fallback to global translations for those records?
2013-02-18 15:39:31	vanstee	With the presence validation on title and description, trying to save a translation with title or description set to nil fails, so I'm guessing it's just bad legacy data.

2013-02-19 16:39:57	zdennis	*if
2013-02-19 16:41:23	zdennis	vanstee: the goal was to disconnect the need to explicitly reset the email deliveries in a cucumber feature with two secondary goals: have it be discoverable and intuitive as possible.
2013-02-19 16:42:30	zdennis	in the cukes I was working on the resetting of email deliveries was associated with the changing of time, so I thought I communicate through a cucumber tag that emails would be reset when we changed time.
2013-02-19 16:42:43	zdennis	man, my typing and english is pretty bad today.
2013-02-19 16:43:16	zdennis	*I thought we could communicate through a cuke tag...
2013-02-19 16:43:38	vanstee	Ok that makes sense. Do we always want to be reseting email deliveries when changing time?
2013-02-19 16:43:41	zdennis	the tag felt like it would make it discoverable and not entirely magical
2013-02-19 16:43:57	vanstee	Ah ok
2013-02-19 16:43:59	zdennis	vanstee, I don't know, I didn't go through all f the other scenarios, that would be interesting to find out
2013-02-19 16:46:07	zdennis	vanstee: the reason I added the time observer was because I wanted to decouple the changing of time from the resetting of emails in order to preserve behavior of existing scenarios, but to also allow me to introduce this new functionality, with minimal impact on the cukes (ie: i didn't want to add a bunch of new step definitions if I could avoid it)
2013-02-19 16:46:31	zdennis	thoughts?

2013-02-19 16:48:58	vanstee	zdennis: I haven't done email related cukes in a while. Why do the deliveries need to be reset in the first place? Is it dependent on the time?
2013-02-19 16:53:36	zdennis	vanstee: no, it's that the email_steps and related functionality makes some assumptions about how you're going to be looking at emails
2013-02-19 16:55:37	zdennis	for example: On Monday I do X (email is sent). Then I should see an email. OK. On Tuesday, I do X (email is sent). Then I should see an email (FAIL…expected 1 email but see 2)
2013-02-19 16:56:36	zdennis	Within a scenario, emails pile up, and looking at them assumes some things (that don't match up with the intuited expectations so it fails)
2013-02-19 16:57:12	zdennis	So resetting them based on time changes allows the above example (On Monday.. On Tuesday) to work as expected.
2013-02-19 16:58:45	zdennis	Although, we could improve on this by introducing better email steps
2013-02-19 16:59:15	zdennis	… ie: Then I should see that "zach@example.com" received an email today
2013-02-19 16:59:31	zdennis	with a few other changes to allow email steps to be more intuitive
2013-02-19 17:00:59	zdennis	I actually kind of like that better
2013-02-19 17:01:19	zdennis	although it may be beyond what we're able to introduce right now (time-wise)
2013-02-19 17:01:23	vanstee	Yeah that's what I'm reading through right now
2013-02-19 17:01:55	vanstee	Yeah I like the observer approach if we don't have a good way to change those email helpers

2013-02-20 15:25:52	vanstee	I might try the multiple documents for the same active record model approach. That seems the cleanest.
2013-02-20 15:27:12	vanstee	We'll just have to loop through a list of locales and set that as an attribute of the solr document. Does that sound right?
2013-02-20 15:27:42	vanstee	Might add some weirdness to the sunspot related code though I guess

2013-02-20 15:32:16	@EC	vanstee: Re: loop through locales – that might work, too
2013-02-20 15:32:55	@EC	vanstee: I was thinking what if a given Intersect lesson could represent multiple Solr lessons
2013-02-20 15:33:27	vanstee	Yeah that's what I'm going to try to do. Although I think sunspot expects there to only be 1
2013-02-20 15:33:40	vanstee	like indexing in another locale would just blow away the previous locales
2013-02-20 15:34:00	vanstee	I'll have to add another locale attribute that's used to pull out records. Not sure how maintainable that will be :/
2013-02-20 15:34:01	@EC	I’m not sure Sunspot will even let you create another. Think it handles app-to-Solr mapping on its own.

2013-02-20 15:34:21	vanstee	I'm guessing we can just add a locale field here or something: https://github.com/sunspot/sunspot/blob/master/sunspot/lib/sunspot/indexer.rb#L117
2013-02-20 15:34:59	@EC	I don’t want to get into developing our own custom version of Sunspot
2013-02-20 15:35:12	@EC	Because you’re right—that’s not maintainable for us
2013-02-20 15:37:03	vanstee	Hah, here's a crazy idea. Create locale namespaced subclasses of training::lesson and index those.
2013-02-20 15:37:05	@EC	Also then we’d have a difficult time trying to change out Solr adapters should we ever want to
2013-02-20 15:37:16	vanstee	then pull out the document by finding the lesson in a specific locale
2013-02-20 15:37:36	vanstee	it will just use that type field and should allow us to have separate documents of the same training::lesson data
2013-02-20 15:37:36	@EC	That is a crazy idea but a very valid thought
2013-02-20 15:37:52	@EC	Yeah
2013-02-20 15:38:01	@EC	It’s not even terribly dirty
2013-02-20 15:38:28	@EC	Voluminous, though

2013-02-21 10:38:09	gaffneyc	Yeah, we only recently started getting those settings in chef. Had to get set up to handled encrypted data bags

2013-02-21 11:46:43	@EC	That’s about the only thing I can think of
2013-02-21 11:46:49	@EC	But that was released before the 17th
2013-02-21 11:47:04	@EC	I suppose it could have taken several days before it was fully deployed
2013-02-21 11:47:25	@EC	Can you see a difference between the most trafficked routes this week vs. last week?

2013-02-21 11:51:57	gaffneyc	Number of requests

2013-02-21 11:57:55	@EC	Yeah. Harmann had the original messages poll set to 1–2 minutes. That was when it actually pulled every message a user had.
2013-02-21 11:58:06	mshafer	I know of some ways to make the /users/:id/dock route faster
2013-02-21 11:58:20	@EC	You have to get the store import done first.

2013-02-21 12:03:18	gaffneyc	I will pull a ticket for optimizing it as well
2013-02-21 12:03:24	@EC	Sounds good
2013-02-21 12:04:17	gaffneyc	EC: I emailed you the other day about a metadata service… realizing that was probably the wrong path to get it considered. Think I should instead of pulling a ticket in JIRA
2013-02-21 12:04:37	@EC	Depends
2013-02-21 12:04:54	@EC	You can always file new tickets in the feature requests project
2013-02-21 12:05:12	@EC	But if it’s something you want to do soon email is probably better
2013-02-21 12:05:23	@EC	We haven’t even begun going through feature requests
2013-02-21 12:05:34	@EC	Just finished prioritizing bugs
2013-02-21 12:06:07	@EC	I think of the feature requests project as our “Someday/Maybe” list
2013-02-21 12:06:34	gaffneyc	It's something I've been experimenting with while waiting for stuff to process
2013-02-21 12:07:21	gaffneyc	Really want to solve the deployment issues around OS X once and for all
2013-02-21 12:09:21	@EC	You said you think the y-axis in these charts is number of requests per second, right?
2013-02-21 12:09:38	gaffneyc	EC: Earlier question… no we can't determine requests by geography
2013-02-21 12:09:45	@EC	ok
2013-02-21 12:11:15	gaffneyc	EC: Yeah, I'm pretty sure. The number correlate to the munin graphs which are labeled as req/s
2013-02-21 12:12:36	@EC	It seems like Graphite expects you to know what the units are (since the label display is just a text box for you to type in). Is that because we configure what values it should collect?
2013-02-21 12:13:27	@EC	Are we still running 60 server processes per app server?
2013-02-21 12:15:50	@EC	Trying to identify what percentage of our overall server processes are occupied over the course of 1 minute by message polling.
2013-02-21 12:16:37	@EC	Actually that doesn’t work huh
2013-02-21 12:18:16	@EC	It would be about 10% of our capacity at peak time
2013-02-21 12:18:23	@EC	Dedicated to message polling
2013-02-21 12:18:40	gaffneyc	EC: I think all counters are per second
2013-02-21 12:18:49	@EC	During a quiet time of year
2013-02-21 12:19:14	gaffneyc	EC: We have a pool of 10 workers at all time (so 60 total) and can scale up to 32 per server
2013-02-21 12:19:36	@EC	Ohhh
2013-02-21 12:19:46	@EC	I thought we had up to 60 per server at one time?
2013-02-21 12:19:52	gaffneyc	http://munin-retailme.apple.com/retailme.apple.com/app/comparison-week.html#app
2013-02-21 12:20:17	gaffneyc	We did, but we had to drop that because we started swapping about ~30
2013-02-21 12:20:43	@EC	In that case 20% of capacity is consumed by polling at peak time of day during a quiet time of year

2013-02-21 12:22:27	gaffneyc	Once the rails 3.2 upgrade is finished I'd love to consider ruby 2.0 as well.
2013-02-21 12:22:32	@EC	Check my math on this?
2013-02-21 12:22:50	gaffneyc	The copy-on-write garbage collector should help out with memory per process
2013-02-21 12:22:54	gaffneyc	EC: Sure
2013-02-21 12:24:25	@EC	(6 polls/sec × 6 servers) / (32 processes × 6 servers)
2013-02-21 12:24:48	@EC	0.1875
2013-02-21 12:25:22	gaffneyc	The 6 req/s is across all servers
2013-02-21 12:25:30	gaffneyc	Err… no. That is per server
2013-02-21 12:26:20	gaffneyc	We break up stats per server, I don't know if you can like sum one set of attributes but not another in the same line
2013-02-21 12:26:34	gaffneyc	At peak we are doing 40 req/s to all servers
2013-02-21 12:27:05	@EC	Yeah this calculation assumes app1 is representative of all 6
2013-02-21 12:27:20	gaffneyc	Mean response time is 400ms, upper is 500-600 (lets just use 500)
2013-02-21 12:27:27	gaffneyc	Yeah
2013-02-21 12:27:49	gaffneyc	So each application instance can serve 2 polls per second
2013-02-21 12:27:58	@EC	That’s a good point
2013-02-21 12:28:20	gaffneyc	(40 / 2) / (32 * 6) = 0.104166667
2013-02-21 12:28:30	gaffneyc	So 10%?
2013-02-21 12:28:55	@EC	I got 9.3%
2013-02-21 12:29:06	@EC	Not stellar but not as bad
2013-02-21 12:29:09	gaffneyc	(40 / 2) / (10 * 6) = 0.333333333
2013-02-21 12:29:20	gaffneyc	Though it's 30% of our baseline capacity before scaling
2013-02-21 12:30:04	gaffneyc	We generally don't use more than our baseline but we've scaling up extra processes
2013-02-21 12:37:27	@EC	Oh wow
2013-02-21 12:37:33	@EC	It’s actually set to poll every 30 seconds
2013-02-21 12:39:36	gaffneyc	Hah, that seems more than a bit aggressive
2013-02-21 12:43:15	@EC	k
2013-02-21 12:43:24	@EC	Requested decrease to once per 5 minutes or more
2013-02-21 12:43:32	@EC	Thanks for noticing and sharing that
2013-02-21 12:45:29	gaffneyc	Just glad we have all those stats in graphite now to make it easy to pull that data out
2013-02-21 12:45:38	gaffneyc	Though now I need to sit down and learn more about graphite
2013-02-21 12:53:59	gaffneyc	EC: Regarding per second numbers. I think this is relevant: http://graphite.readthedocs.org/en/0.9.10/functions.html#graphite.render.functions.summarize

2013-02-21 12:55:06	gaffneyc	Allows you to set the units you want (though I still believe the default is per second)
2013-02-21 12:57:57	@EC	gaffneyc: Ditto on the read-up. It’s clearly a much more flexible system but that came with a lot to know about it.
2013-02-21 12:58:35	@EC	gaffneyc: Chris Purcell is going to change the polling frequency to once per 5 minutes
2013-02-21 12:58:36	gaffneyc	Reminder: We have a dash board up as well http://graphite-retailme.apple.com/dashboard/#RetailMe
2013-02-21 12:59:19	stevenharman	does anyone know how the Rails 3.2 upgrade is going?
2013-02-21 12:59:41	stevenharman	We are hitting some serious limitations with MongoMapper and large numbers of embedded docs.
2013-02-21 12:59:57	@EC	gaffneyc: For a positive perspective on the last touch update take a look at what it did to the number of requests per second on the messages#index and tasks#index routes
2013-02-21 13:03:26	gaffneyc	Definitely a nice drop: http://graphite-retailme.apple.com/render/?width=1133&height=633&_salt=1361469779.887&target=sum(stats.retailme.action_controller.MessagesController.index.status.200.*)&target=sum(stats.retailme.action_controller.Calendars_TasksController.index.status.200.*)&from=-1months
2013-02-21 13:04:20	@EC	gaffneyc: Is there a group email address for the Collective Idea subgroup working on Intersect?
2013-02-21 13:04:26	gaffneyc	But it seems a bit underwhelming compared to the increase to Users#dock

2013-02-21 13:05:38	vanstee	I feel like I've run into this before but is sunspot setup in a way that normal indexing doesn't work?
2013-02-21 13:05:47	stevenharman	EC: We're running out of things to try. The Internet seems to say that Mongoid is the reasonable workaround, but that requires ActiveModel >= 3.1. Also, as jonathanwallace mentioned, we're unsure of the work required to switch over.
2013-02-21 13:05:53	vanstee	I'm trying Sunspot.index(model); Sunspot.commit and it doesn't seem to be changing the index.

2013-02-21 13:10:52	gaffneyc	Damn
2013-02-21 13:11:10	gaffneyc	vanstee: What do you mean normal indexing?
2013-02-21 13:11:48	gaffneyc	vanstee: Solr should be configured to auto commit every 30s or 10k requests. sunspot-queue does not do a commit after indexing
2013-02-21 13:12:06	gaffneyc	vanstee: Oh! That's because it is being enqueued to be run by a resque job
2013-02-21 13:12:07	jonathanwallace	s
2013-02-21 13:12:10	vanstee	gaffneyc: Shouldn't: "Sunspot.index(model); Sunspot.commit" still work though, or is that somehow disabled.
2013-02-21 13:12:11	jonathanwallace	oops, wrong window
2013-02-21 13:12:20	vanstee	hem, wasn't seeing anything in the rescue queue
2013-02-21 13:12:50	gaffneyc	stevenharman: What are you guys running into with mongomapper?
2013-02-21 13:15:42	jonathanwallace	gaffneyc: https://greenhopper.apple.com/browse/RMETR-415
2013-02-21 13:16:20	gaffneyc	Callbacks?
2013-02-21 13:16:24	jonathanwallace	even with the patch described in https://github.com/jnunemaker/mongomapper/pull/265#issuecomment-4587562, we're still having problems
2013-02-21 13:16:26	jonathanwallace	yep
2013-02-21 13:17:14	gaffneyc	The ticket alone doesn't give a good overview of the issue
2013-02-21 13:17:17	jonathanwallace	i'm going to recreate the error right now, but it is a Null Context pointer that occurs deep inside the eval of the callbacks
2013-02-21 13:17:35	jonathanwallace	https://greenhopper.apple.com/browse/RMETR-408 is also relevant
2013-02-21 13:17:38	gaffneyc	I know people run into this occasionally, the ruby stack can get really deep.
2013-02-21 13:18:25	jonathanwallace	the error is actually thrown by nokogiri but i'm somewhat at a loss as how to debug things that occur inside of evals
2013-02-21 13:18:34	jonathanwallace	the current plan is to try to recreate the error in an automated test
2013-02-21 13:18:34	gaffneyc	Someone could do the world a favor and rewrite the ActiveModel callbacks code to not use all that meta programming craziness
2013-02-21 13:19:45	vanstee	gaffneyc: I think we actually added the evals to make the callbacks less recursive. It's pretty much full of black magic at this point :(
2013-02-21 13:20:15	gaffneyc	vanstee: In ActiveModel or elsewhere?
2013-02-21 13:20:46	vanstee	Specially for mongomapper, but they use the active model callbacks.
2013-02-21 13:22:06	gaffneyc	vanstee: Sorry, still confused could you point me to the eval could you're talking about?
2013-02-21 13:22:17	jonathanwallace	gaffneyc: see https://github.com/jnunemaker/mongomapper/pull/265#issuecomment-4587562
2013-02-21 13:22:32	jonathanwallace	you can find the eval in the last two methods in the comment
2013-02-21 13:22:55	gaffneyc	I wrote most of the MongoMapper ActiveModel support way back with Brian Ryckbost and Brandon Keepers
2013-02-21 13:22:58	vanstee	Here's our implementation of that: https://code.apple.com/RetailSoftwareEngineering/intersect/blob/training/lib/mongo_mapper_ext/embedded_callbacks.rb
2013-02-21 13:23:31	vanstee	gaffneyc: It's really just the callbacks for embedded documents that are causing us issues
2013-02-21 13:23:38	gaffneyc	For https://code.apple.com/RetailSoftwareEngineering/intersect/blob/training/lib/mongo_mapper_ext/embedded_callbacks.rb#L26
2013-02-21 13:23:51	gaffneyc	Couldn't we add line information to that?
2013-02-21 13:23:59	gaffneyc	Or is that only useful for heredocs?
2013-02-21 13:25:42	@EC	stevenharman: Can you identify the number of legacy lessons that we would be unable to migrate if we did not support lengthy, complex lessons?
2013-02-21 13:25:58	@EC	Ballpark estimate/
2013-02-21 13:27:29	gaffneyc	Grabbing lunch… back in a bit
2013-02-21 13:27:34	vanstee	gaffneyc: Pretty sure you can add file/line context to evals
2013-02-21 13:28:36	gaffneyc	You can (http://dalibornasevic.com/posts/16-ruby-class_eval-__file__-and-__line__-arguments)
2013-02-21 13:28:36	stevenharman	vanstee or jonathanwallace Didn't we overcome the stack too deep stuff in importer by temporarily disabling callbacks?
2013-02-21 13:28:37	gaffneyc	But in this case it may not be that useful since the before / after code is not generated at the same spot as the eval

2013-02-21 13:29:15	vanstee	gaffneyc: right, you wouldn't be able to just use __FILE__ __LINE__
2013-02-21 13:29:48	stevenharman	So I *think* we were able to import the lessons. But if you edit them, we'll probably fail w/a timeout (which looks to be caused by the error jonathanwallace is describing)
2013-02-21 13:30:01	stevenharman	We've been focused on a specific set of test examples the QA folks described in the JIRA cards.
2013-02-21 13:30:31	stevenharman	Where we create a Lesson w/a Step that has 4-8 Grid items. Then duplicate that step 40-ish times.

2013-02-21 13:56:02	@EC	jonathanwallace: My experience has been that you seem to get a segault or null context pointer in between an acceptable-length lesson and a ridiculous-length lesson
2013-02-21 13:56:08	@EC	It’s like your tiptoeing into the problem
2013-02-21 13:56:18	gaffneyc	Have you tried it with a recent version of ruby?
2013-02-21 13:56:23	@EC	I.e. increase the lesson complexity by another 5 steps and it will go into the stack level error
2013-02-21 13:56:36	jonathanwallace	i'm on ruby 1.9.3p125 (2012-02-16 revision 34643) [x86_64-darwin12.2.0]
2013-02-21 13:56:53	gaffneyc	Though we have some servers on 125 we should be upgrading them due potential DOS issues
2013-02-21 13:57:11	stevenharman	gaffneyc: what patch-level should we be running?
2013-02-21 13:57:36	@EC	stevenharman: Re: not migrating too-complex lessons I’m thinking even though we know we can import them, if we can’t work with them after import one option is to not import them in the first place and just not support lessons of a certain complexity (for now, anyway)
2013-02-21 13:57:59	stevenharman	Ah, now I see what you're getting at.
2013-02-21 13:57:59	@EC	stevenharman: Content creators wouldn’t be able to create new too-complex lessons because they wouldn’t be able to save them
2013-02-21 13:58:01	gaffneyc	stevenharman: 1.9.3p385. It fixes some segfaults in the last patch level
2013-02-21 13:58:11	@EC	stevenharman: But that’s all dependent on the extent of the impact to the existing content
2013-02-21 13:58:27	stevenharman	Sure. And we don't really know what "too large" is.
2013-02-21 13:59:28	jonathanwallace	here's the gist of the steps to reproduce in the comments with the Null Context pointer error, https://code.apple.com/gist/418
2013-02-21 14:02:50	jonathanwallace	i'm going to attach those gists to the card
2013-02-21 14:02:57	gaffneyc	What is before_code and after_code?
2013-02-21 14:03:36	gaffneyc	I mean, what are the values at the time. I know the callback code is complex but is it something we could extract and just include the values in there without doing the compile phase?
2013-02-21 14:04:13	vanstee	gaffneyc: its the code before the yield and after the yield in the callback method we're running
2013-02-21 14:04:41	vanstee	It's pretty dirty
2013-02-21 14:06:48	gaffneyc	Are we getting the same errors with the sequential code as we're getting with the recursive version? Are they different?
2013-02-21 14:07:53	vanstee	We were getting stack level too deep errors with the recursive version so we never got to the point were it's erroring out. Might be worth running on a box with lot more stack space to make sure it's not a bug in that crazy eval code.
2013-02-21 14:08:15	gaffneyc	Yeah
2013-02-21 14:08:45	gaffneyc	I'm just wondering if the recursive stuff is really hiding other errors

2013-02-22 12:02:32	laserlemon	:point_up:
2013-02-22 12:02:59	laserlemon	so long story short, we're actively working on the 3.2 upgrade
2013-02-22 12:03:02	laserlemon	in two phases
2013-02-22 12:03:06	laserlemon	1. upgrade to 3.1
2013-02-22 12:03:08	laserlemon	2. upgrade to 3.2
2013-02-22 12:03:45	laserlemon	we're a day away (tops, i'd say) from finishing the 3.1 upgrade
2013-02-22 12:04:41	laserlemon	well, i guess that timeline depends on the craziness of some of the remaining cucumber failures
2013-02-22 12:05:23	jonathanwallace	which branch did you use as the starting point of the upgrade?
2013-02-22 12:05:50	laserlemon	actually, update-capistrano
2013-02-22 12:05:57	laserlemon	sorry, collectiveidea/update-capistrano
2013-02-22 12:06:21	laserlemon	we cut from that branch because we were unable to bundle install master
2013-02-22 12:06:46	laserlemon	but since then, collectiveidea/udpate-capistrano has been pulled in (at least to next-release)
2013-02-22 12:07:07	laserlemon	collectiveidea/update-capistrano was a one-commit branch off of master
2013-02-22 12:07:11	laserlemon	(convoluted, i know)
2013-02-22 12:08:38	jonathanwallace	heh, yep. that's par for the course with a project this large IME
2013-02-22 12:10:01	jonathanwallace	stevenharman: correct me if i'm wrong, but i think our plan is to grab training and rebase against the head of your branch (i bet git rerere will come in handy here) and then base our spike of mongoid on the resulting branch
2013-02-22 12:12:20	laserlemon	having spent a lot of time in the mongomapper code (but having little/no mongoid experience), i'll say… Godspeed
2013-02-22 12:12:55	laserlemon	i imagine a conversion will be very involved
2013-02-22 12:13:02	jonathanwallace	yeah, i would think so too
2013-02-22 12:13:28	laserlemon	but while i like a lot about MM, mongoid is better supported/maintained
2013-02-22 12:15:09	jonathanwallace	yeah, we're down to this last issue before we can close out the training project and move forward. i just sent the email that has links to a pair of gists detailing the difference
2013-02-22 12:15:47	stevenharman	jonathanwallace: that was the plan I had in mind. But we are open to ideas.
2013-02-22 12:25:12	laserlemon	i left comments, but those gists seem fishy
2013-02-22 12:30:07	stevenharman	Commenting back.
2013-02-22 12:30:17	stevenharman	I hate that github doesn't send notifications of replies to Gists.

2013-02-26 12:57:16	@EC	I’ll take a look in 5 minutes
2013-02-26 13:08:08	gaffneyc	Is anyone using parallel_tests?
2013-02-26 13:09:05	zdennis	gaffneyc: we haven't been using it regularly
2013-02-26 13:09:47	gaffneyc	zdennis: Ah okay. Does it help with test times that much?
2013-02-26 13:10:02	gaffneyc	I remember when it was added and it added a bit of complexity to certain configs
2013-02-26 13:10:45	zdennis	gaffneyc: IIRC, it cut them down by about 33%, but there are certain tests that couldn't be run in parallel (or they'd fail), there wasn't very many though, may 3 - 5 and they may have all been cukes
2013-02-26 13:13:40	@EC	I don’t use it at all
2013-02-26 13:13:46	@EC	Did at one time and it made a big difference
2013-02-26 13:14:07	gaffneyc	Just wondering if it's worth removing
2013-02-26 13:14:08	@EC	But it takes more effort to run so I eventually abandoned it
2013-02-26 13:14:14	@EC	I thought about that, too
2013-02-26 13:14:25	@EC	Unless you find someone who wants it I’d say gut it
2013-02-26 13:14:55	@EC	If we ever get a CI server setup the way we want it will probably become irrelevant anyway
2013-02-26 13:20:14	gaffneyc	People are still using Spork right?
2013-02-26 13:20:51	@EC	I was using back when I had enough time to implement a feature or a bug
2013-02-26 13:20:54	@EC	Those days are gone, though
2013-02-26 13:24:23	@EC	zdennis: There’s a change I’d like to make without having to go through the process of documenting it in a story, scheduling it for execution, QA’ing it, etc.
2013-02-26 13:24:29	zdennis	gaffneyc: I use spork although my opinion's relevance is limited :)
2013-02-26 13:24:37	@EC	zdennis: And it occurs in the lib/medallia area
2013-02-26 13:24:39	zdennis	EC: shoot
2013-02-26 13:25:00	@EC	zdennis: Wondering if you want to slip it into the work you’re doing or if I should just do a quick branch and PR
2013-02-26 13:25:04	gaffneyc	I was thinking about updating it to 0.9.2 since we're on a release candidate
2013-02-26 13:25:25	@EC	zdennis: I’d like the app to stop sending notifications that a matching user could not be found for a Medallia survey
2013-02-26 13:25:40	@EC	zdennis: There are expected conditions under which this can occur
2013-02-26 13:25:52	@EC	Such as a user who does not now nor has ever used RetailMe
2013-02-26 13:26:03	zdennis	EC: okay
2013-02-26 13:26:16	@EC	If they haven’t signed into the system and we don’t know about them from some other source they won’t exist in our database
2013-02-26 13:26:17	zdennis	EC: would you like those logged any where or are you thinking of just ommitting them altogether?
2013-02-26 13:26:44	@EC	For the purposes of getting it done quickly I was thinking of just omitting them
2013-02-26 13:27:13	@EC	If we find that our team or the support team is spending a lot of time trying to debug NPS issues we can add logging then
2013-02-26 13:27:34	@EC	The app sent 13,000 emails to us last night :)
2013-02-26 13:27:43	zdennis	wow
2013-02-26 13:27:50	@EC	Mail has been trying to mark them as read for over an hour
2013-02-26 13:28:04	zdennis	EC: we can take that out by this afternoon
2013-02-26 13:28:23	@EC	Sweet
2013-02-26 13:28:24	@EC	Thanks
2013-02-26 13:28:37	gaffneyc	EC: lol, I got that burst too. Freaked out for a second until I saw the source
2013-02-26 13:30:48	@EC	I suspect Medallia may have done something wrong to their data
2013-02-26 13:31:04	@EC	In this case
2013-02-26 13:31:17	@EC	But that can also be expected behavior under normal conditions
2013-02-26 13:34:09	@EC	zdennis: In fact, as I’m auditing some of these 13k emails the DSIDs supplied by Medallia in each instance so far does, in fact, appear to be invalid. None of them match an employee in Apple Directory.
2013-02-26 13:34:14	@EC	Ohhh
2013-02-26 13:34:19	@EC	Maybe it’s for a contractor or vendor
2013-02-26 13:34:23	@EC	Checking
2013-02-26 13:36:56	gaffneyc	EC: I plan the next couple days looking at the white_screen module. I want to diagnose the 400 issues we're seeing on the new load balancers and test out the memcached module that Barry wrote last year.
2013-02-26 13:37:20	gaffneyc	I've made some changes on master and working on a testing harness.
2013-02-26 13:37:21	gaffneyc	https://code.apple.com/RetailSoftwareEngineering/white_screen/commits/master
2013-02-26 13:37:50	zdennis	EC:  you'll get a kick out of this. You know how they added a field last time to house the employee DSIDs for all surveys? Well by all surveys, they meant just the ones we were working on. A bunch of JV surveys use additional fields to house employee DSID.
2013-02-26 13:40:35	@EC	gaffneyc: Sweet. That’s great. It would be nice not to have to buy it a cake for its third birthday.
2013-02-26 13:40:49	@EC	zdennis: lol
2013-02-26 13:41:04	@EC	zdennis: Yes, I did enjoy that. Thank you.
2013-02-26 13:41:27	gaffneyc	EC: lol, I don't think we can kill it… just make it better.
2013-02-26 13:41:34	@EC	:'(
2013-02-26 13:41:44	@EC	Another blank white cake, then.
2013-02-26 13:42:01	gaffneyc	EC: I liked Barry's LUA implementation but it would be a giant pain to deploy
2013-02-26 13:42:15	@EC	God. Barry and Lua.
2013-02-26 13:43:14	@EC	zdennis: FYI – not sure what Medallia is doing over there but it looks like most of the 13,000 users that could not be found last night are because there are no employees in the company with those DSIDs
2013-02-26 13:43:30	@EC	zdennis: Makes me wonder if some other number “slipped” into that field
2013-02-26 13:43:46	@EC	zdennis: Given their stringent data integrity practices
2013-02-26 13:45:39	zdennis	EC: they could be the concierge IDs
2013-02-26 13:45:42	@EC	zdennis: It also looks like Medallia made a big change to *all* existing surveys. A bunch of the surveys described in these error notices have accepted dates in 2007.
2013-02-26 13:46:04	@EC	zdennis: Maybe they’re adding a new column for you
2013-02-26 13:46:07	zdennis	EC: I believe they map concierge IDs to DSIDs at some point. 
2013-02-26 13:46:21	zdennis	EC: ah
2013-02-26 13:46:39	@EC	Since the unified DSID field isn’t enough
2013-02-26 13:47:06	@EC	zdennis: I really hope they’re not putting the Concierge ID in the DSID field
2013-02-26 13:47:15	@EC	zdennis: That could lead to an incorrect association on our part
2013-02-26 13:47:48	zdennis	EC: yes, they shouldn't be come to think of it. That was partially why we created the new ar_all_employee_dsid field
2013-02-26 13:48:07	zdennis	EC: do you have access to the system that uses concierge IDs?
2013-02-26 13:48:14	zdennis	could you look up one of those numbers?
2013-02-26 13:48:48	@EC	zdennis: Shouldn’t be ≠ isn’t
2013-02-26 13:49:11	@EC	I don’t, unfortunately
2013-02-26 13:49:11	zdennis	tru dat
2013-02-26 13:51:34	zdennis	EC: do you know who the guy is in the customer loyalty group that manages the Medallia survey structure on the apple-side?
2013-02-26 13:51:44	zdennis	Chris something...
2013-02-26 13:52:01	@EC	Chapo?
2013-02-26 13:52:15	zdennis	yes! that's the guy!
2013-02-26 13:52:21	@EC	Yeah. He went to JC Penney.
2013-02-26 13:52:26	zdennis	OH NO
2013-02-26 13:52:28	zdennis	arrggh.
2013-02-26 13:52:32	@EC	Ron’s house.
2013-02-26 13:52:45	@EC	New strategy. Hold please.
2013-02-26 13:53:59	zdennis	EC: I need to push back this card related to verifying medallia roles. I have a recommendation but I don't think I should be the guy to close it. I was going to suggest having you, Kurt, or someone from Customer Loytal (perhaps Chris Chapo) to provide us with feedback/confirmation to close out the card and move forward.
2013-02-26 13:55:42	@EC	zdennis: This is related to QA trying to verify resolution, right?
2013-02-26 13:56:46	zdennis	EC: not directly. It's just verifying that we're using the right roles based on a file of roles/permissions that Medallia sent Jayne, and Jayne sent us.
2013-02-26 13:56:54	zdennis	card RMEEH-425
2013-02-26 13:57:17	zdennis	AFAIK, there will be no changes because of this card, but new card that require changes may come out of it
2013-02-26 13:58:44	@EC	425 is undefined method “map”
2013-02-26 13:58:52	zdennis	er.. 423
2013-02-26 14:00:36	@EC	zdennis: Yeah, I’ll take 423
2013-02-26 14:00:45	@EC	Assign it to me when you’re done with it
2013-02-26 14:01:02	zdennis	okay, you will have it in a couple of minutes :)
2013-02-26 14:01:40	zdennis	thanks
2013-02-26 14:03:53	@EC	zdennis: Faith restored (to previous level) in Medallia’s integrity of the DSID field
2013-02-26 14:04:06	@EC	Used the NPS website to match the numbers to names
2013-02-26 14:04:13	@EC	I think what happened is Medallia made a change
2013-02-26 14:04:44	@EC	That caused a massive amount of surveys dating back to 2007 (or before) to update their updated-at time
2013-02-26 14:04:50	@EC	Which caused our app to try and sync them
2013-02-26 14:05:16	@EC	And we ran into employees who were at Apple in 2007 but had left by the time RetailMe started collecting employee information in 2009
2013-02-26 14:05:40	@EC	And so those DSIDs are neither in RetailMe’s records nor Apple’s current-employee records
2013-02-26 14:21:40	@EC	zdennis: How is the Joint Venture work coming?

2013-02-26 14:57:18	zdennis	EC: since you and druibarra have set up QA1 for NPS testing. Do you want us to merge directly into next-release now? (rather than merging into net_promoter_comments)
2013-02-26 14:57:44	zdennis	Our plan before was merge to net_promoter_comments for testing then open PR for net_promoter_comments -> next-release
2013-02-26 14:57:53	zdennis	but I don't know that that makes sense now
2013-02-26 14:58:13	@EC	I think it can all go into next-release at any time, probably
2013-02-26 14:58:25	@EC	Are there any changes that aren’t backwards compatible?
2013-02-26 14:58:37	zdennis	no
2013-02-26 14:58:47	@EC	Or that need to be withheld from release for some reason?
2013-02-26 15:00:04	zdennis	i don't think so, we did final integration testing on -dev3 before so I think it made sense to keep work off from next-release until that occurred
2013-02-26 15:00:38	zdennis	i assume we can still use -dev3 for final integration testing during development on our own, but submit PR to next-release
2013-02-26 15:01:17	@EC	Sure
2013-02-26 15:03:14	@EC	You’re welcome to use an integration branch when you see benefit. About the only time we’ll “require” them is if there are backwards-incompatible changes or changes that otherwise need to be released in-sync with the client or other changes.
2013-02-26 15:03:47	@EC	In most other cases it’s fine to deliver to next-release even if the overarching epic isn’t complete.
2013-02-26 15:04:09	@EC	Like if your project was 5 stories but each story delivers some whole benefit on its own.
2013-02-26 15:04:26	@EC	You could deliver each of the 5 into next-release as you finish them.
2013-02-26 15:04:33	@EC	Even if it occurs over several releases.
2013-02-26 15:05:23	@EC	Last time on NPS we put it in a long-running branch because Customer Loyalty wanted to do a scheduled, big-splash-style release
2013-02-26 15:05:37	@EC	So we held all the NPS stuff until they were ready to make the big announcement
2013-02-26 15:06:44	zdennis	okay

2013-02-26 16:35:08	laserlemon	who needs help and where?
2013-02-26 16:35:53	vanstee	I remember having to fork a bunch of gems to fix a few things. Did you guys have to do that as well?
2013-02-26 16:36:04	laserlemon	i think only one?

2013-02-26 16:36:39	laserlemon	also, the 3.1 upgrade PR is still out there: https://code.apple.com/RetailSoftwareEngineering/intersect/pull/415
2013-02-26 16:36:55	laserlemon	don't know if that's still pertinent or if 3.2 just trumps and we can close that out
2013-02-26 16:37:07	ErsatzRyan	3.1 was more of a pain in terms of gems because we had to find the right versions. For 3.2 usually the latest worked

2013-02-28 16:31:59	stevenharman	Ugh, I just realized we're running on a custom (via github) Resque.
2013-02-28 16:32:32	stevenharman	The good news is that the change we wanted has been rolled into Resque 2. But we'll need to upgrade from 1.20 to 2.0
2013-02-28 16:33:56	zdennis	stevenharman, sometimes I think policies behind privatizing every code change to open source libs costs more than adds value

2013-02-28 16:35:38	stevenharman	zdennis: I'm sure that change was needed, but it sucks that it wasn't rolled into the 1.x series. But it does exist in 2.0

2013-02-28 16:36:54	jonathanwallace	when mike skalnik was interviewing at github with defunkt, he asked him his opinion about what resque needed?  mike's answer: "a maintainer"

2013-03-07 12:30:13	@EC	But in the meantime, if you need to build on 3.2 base your work off the branch “rails-3-2-upgrade” which will serve as master for the upgrade

2013-03-08 15:43:17	@EC	Starting with what is the responsibility of #to_intersect
2013-03-08 15:43:23	@EC	And why
2013-03-08 15:44:32	@EC	I can tell you that at the moment something does not seem quite right about the refactor

2013-03-08 15:44:38	@EC	But I’m not sure what yet
2013-03-08 15:45:33	stevenharman	What do you mean #to_intersect
2013-03-08 15:45:47	stevenharman	There is #publish_to_intersect, and #to_intersect_model
2013-03-08 15:46:45	stevenharman	#to_intersect_model  was abused before... it would return the "linked" intersect-side model, or build a new one in the event one did not yet exist.
2013-03-08 15:48:12	stevenharman	and then it would ALSO start copying stuff over to the intersect side...
2013-03-08 15:48:38	stevenharman	now it just returns the linked or new Intersect-side object.
2013-03-08 15:49:53	stevenharman	Even that does responsibility ultimately does not belong on the Creator objects. As part of our big rewrite we're tearing that out and putting it into a discrete Publication::Resolver object which knows how to find, or build, the intersect-side object for a Creator object.
2013-03-08 15:50:53	@EC	I meant #to_intersect_model
2013-03-08 15:51:00	@EC	Resolver sounds great
2013-03-08 15:53:27	stevenharman	Ah, OK. So yeah... what I said then. And most of this machinery already existed, so I'm trying to take small, atomic steps toward a better solution.
2013-03-08 15:53:52	@EC	Yep
2013-03-08 15:54:05	@EC	Pulled up some history on this
2013-03-08 15:54:11	@EC	Will put it in the PR so all can reference
2013-03-08 15:54:18	stevenharman	OK.

2013-03-13 15:19:32	@EC	Let’s do background on the saveNowHack first
2013-03-13 15:19:58	laserlemon	would this be better as a hangout/call?
2013-03-13 15:22:33	@EC	No, I think it’s good to do here so all can see
2013-03-13 15:22:39	@EC	Plus I’m multitasking
2013-03-13 15:22:52	@EC	I don’t understand the full details of saveNowHack…
2013-03-13 15:22:58	@EC	…but I know the problem it is intended to solve.
2013-03-13 15:23:15	@EC	The way some objects are modeled client-side in CoreData…
2013-03-13 15:23:29	@EC	…CoreData cannot detect that they have changed.
2013-03-13 15:23:42	@EC	As a result it does not fire requests to the server to persist the change.
2013-03-13 15:23:52	@EC	And the way the clients are designed…
2013-03-13 15:24:07	@EC	…developers can’t trigger requests directly.
2013-03-13 15:24:39	@EC	There’s a lot of magic between the data layer and the user layer intended to abstract away developer concerns for persistence.
2013-03-13 15:24:43	@EC	Anyway.
2013-03-13 15:24:52	@EC	To work around this change-detection issue.
2013-03-13 15:25:09	@EC	Some parts of the clients add a “saveNowHack” key and set a value.
2013-03-13 15:25:16	@EC	Doing so is observable by CoreData
2013-03-13 15:25:28	@EC	So the change is detected and the server request fired
2013-03-13 15:25:37	@EC	Hence the “hack” to “save now”
2013-03-13 15:25:44	@EC	Ridiculous, right?
2013-03-13 15:25:46	@EC	Right.
2013-03-13 15:26:08	@EC	Making sense so far?
2013-03-13 15:26:35	laserlemon	40%
2013-03-13 15:26:35	@EC	If so, we can move on to history.
2013-03-13 15:26:42	laserlemon	in that case, 51%
2013-03-13 15:26:50	@EC	Aware of any questions you have yet?
2013-03-13 15:27:12	laserlemon	no, all set
2013-03-13 15:27:15	@EC	Ok
2013-03-13 15:27:18	@EC	History
2013-03-13 15:27:28	@EC	As usual, history was developer in a rush
2013-03-13 15:27:56	@EC	And the developer thought, “Oh, I’ll just put it in the user’s profile! That holds anything!”
2013-03-13 15:28:02	@EC	Which is always the wrong thought to have
2013-03-13 15:28:16	@EC	But sometimes code that works wins over code that’s sustainable
2013-03-13 15:28:31	@EC	Prior to that a UserProfile
2013-03-13 15:28:40	@EC	Was intended to hold descriptive things about the user
2013-03-13 15:28:46	@EC	like “aboutMe”
2013-03-13 15:28:57	@EC	Which you can see when you open the “me” section of RetailMe touch
2013-03-13 15:29:05	@EC	It’s your traditional bio., etc.
2013-03-13 15:29:21	@EC	The profile also holds some of the user’s client-side preferences
2013-03-13 15:29:38	laserlemon	right, makes sense
2013-03-13 15:29:40	@EC	Since those need to be available to RetailMe touch on whatever device the employee logs in from (changes use-to-use)
2013-03-13 15:29:56	@EC	And the profile is one of those things that CoreData can’t directly observe changes to
2013-03-13 15:30:02	laserlemon	i assume history needs to be persisted as well, right?
2013-03-13 15:30:02	@EC	So it has to be saved with “saveNowHack”
2013-03-13 15:30:06	@EC	It does
2013-03-13 15:30:10	laserlemon	as opposed to per device
2013-03-13 15:30:16	@EC	Yep
2013-03-13 15:30:25	@EC	It’s intended to be like your browser history
2013-03-13 15:30:49	@EC	And was the solution chosen over a “back button” to let you, say, return to a Download article you were reading from a materials file it linked to
2013-03-13 15:30:58	@EC	Without having to go back to The Download
2013-03-13 15:31:02	@EC	And navigate back to the article
2013-03-13 15:31:16	@EC	However…
2013-03-13 15:31:42	@EC	Another great feature, Activity Feed, records a Facebook-like feed activity when you do certain things
2013-03-13 15:31:49	@EC	And one of them is change your profile (bio.)
2013-03-13 15:31:55	@EC	The problem being
2013-03-13 15:32:02	@EC	If the only change is to your history
2013-03-13 15:32:09	@EC	You didn’t change your bio.
2013-03-13 15:32:10	laserlemon	yes
2013-03-13 15:32:14	@EC	See it?
2013-03-13 15:32:20	@EC	What percentage are we at now?
2013-03-13 15:32:26	laserlemon	80
2013-03-13 15:32:29	@EC	Great
2013-03-13 15:32:32	@EC	Are questions forming?
2013-03-13 15:32:34	laserlemon	wait
2013-03-13 15:32:35	laserlemon	79
2013-03-13 15:32:38	@EC	Dammit
2013-03-13 15:32:41	@EC	How did we lose 1?
2013-03-13 15:32:45	laserlemon	i forget
2013-03-13 15:32:51	@EC	Crap.
2013-03-13 15:32:55	ErsatzRyan	see what i have to work with here?
2013-03-13 15:33:01	@EC	I feel for you.
2013-03-13 15:33:18	@EC	What info. can I provide to get you the next 21%?
2013-03-13 15:33:25	laserlemon	ok, so we saw that the profile ignores the history
2013-03-13 15:33:26	@EC	Or 20% depending on the moment
2013-03-13 15:33:35	laserlemon	in order to stop polluting the activity feed
2013-03-13 15:33:51	laserlemon	but as a side effect, it *totally* ignores history
2013-03-13 15:33:56	@EC	Yep
2013-03-13 15:33:57	laserlemon	as in, never saves it to the database
2013-03-13 15:34:04	@EC	It just moved the turd around the litterbox instead of covering it
2013-03-13 15:34:17	@EC	Or Jirabox as the case is
2013-03-13 15:34:22	laserlemon	the client's sending history for no reason
2013-03-13 15:34:27	laserlemon	at the moment
2013-03-13 15:34:43	@EC	Likely due to its timer
2013-03-13 15:34:54	laserlemon	no, that's not what i mean
2013-03-13 15:34:57	@EC	I believe it “just saves” the history every x seconds
2013-03-13 15:34:59	@EC	Oh
2013-03-13 15:35:11	laserlemon	it's sending history and the server is saying… "history? i don't care about history!"
2013-03-13 15:35:18	laserlemon	and it's filtered out. never saved to the profile
2013-03-13 15:35:20	@EC	Ah ah ah
2013-03-13 15:35:21	@EC	Got it
2013-03-13 15:35:23	@EC	Right
2013-03-13 15:35:25	@EC	Which is wrong
2013-03-13 15:35:27	laserlemon	yes

2013-03-13 15:37:37	laserlemon_	so we can do a couple things
2013-03-13 15:37:44	@EC	3.2 is integrated
2013-03-13 15:37:51	laserlemon_	we can change the user profile back to store history

2013-03-13 15:38:14	jonathanwallace	:EC:++
2013-03-13 15:38:15	laserlemon_	and we'd make the profile register as unchanged, even if history has changed

2013-03-13 15:38:30	###	laserlemon_ is now known as laserlemon
2013-03-13 15:38:34	laserlemon	to avoid triggering activity creation
2013-03-13 15:38:48	@EC	Yep
2013-03-13 15:38:48	laserlemon	that's option #1
2013-03-13 15:38:50	@EC	k
2013-03-13 15:38:58	laserlemon	option #2 is a little more involved but we can store history elsewhere
2013-03-13 15:39:02	laserlemon	(don't know where yet)
2013-03-13 15:39:44	@EC	Yep. Kenny and I just started discussing that in the story.
2013-03-13 15:39:51	laserlemon	option #2 would ideally involve a client change as well
2013-03-13 15:39:53	@EC	I have some ideas on where.
2013-03-13 15:39:56	@EC	Yep.
2013-03-13 15:40:40	laserlemon	is that the way you wanna go? we know we can bandaid what we have pretty quickly. maybe today
2013-03-13 15:40:56	@EC	At this particular moment a variation of #1 is what I had in mind
2013-03-13 15:41:09	@EC	Although #2 is desirable. Need to discuss it further with Kennard/Barry.
2013-03-13 15:41:26	laserlemon	should ryan and i go ahead with #1 then?
2013-03-13 15:42:14	@EC	I was thinking go back to profile storing history and activity feed deciding whether or not to log a profile-changed activity. The difference between your #1 and my thought is that the decision logic is in Activity Feed instead of in the profile
2013-03-13 15:42:27	@EC	So if you ask the profile if it changed it still considers any change a yes
2013-03-13 15:42:59	laserlemon	that's fine
2013-03-13 15:43:26	@EC	FYI – there’s a good chance we may be able to remove all Activity Feed-related code in the next couple months
2013-03-13 15:43:35	@EC	It has been removed from the UI now to see if anyone noticies
2013-03-13 15:43:37	@EC	*notices
2013-03-13 15:43:40	laserlemon	haha
2013-03-13 15:43:48	laserlemon	i'll notice. and i'll love it
2013-03-13 15:43:54	@EC	I think the Cupertino team is all in favor of removal
2013-03-13 15:44:15	laserlemon	i have one more question about updating a user's profile
2013-03-13 15:44:19	@EC	Shoot
2013-03-13 15:44:58	laserlemon	typically, an API resource update would just update the keys given
2013-03-13 15:45:10	laserlemon	in the case of a user profile, the whole thing is reset (it seems)
2013-03-13 15:45:17	@EC	I believe that is correct
2013-03-13 15:45:19	laserlemon	if i pass {} as a new user profile
2013-03-13 15:45:32	laserlemon	instead of remaining unchanged, the entire profile is wiped out
2013-03-13 15:45:36	laserlemon	is that intended?
2013-03-13 15:46:24	@EC	Yes, I believe so
2013-03-13 15:46:36	@EC	But I can’t immediately explain why
2013-03-13 15:47:14	@EC	Profile has kind of emerged into a general-purpose storage space for the client
2013-03-13 15:47:17	@EC	Unfortunately
2013-03-13 15:47:33	laserlemon	ok, i ask because it *might* be that history is sent over as its own request (maybe not including the other profile information)
2013-03-13 15:47:38	@EC	So it’s pretty much responsible for sending accurate representations of what the profile should be
2013-03-13 15:47:42	laserlemon	in which case, it might wanna wipe everything out
2013-03-13 15:47:47	laserlemon	we'll look into that
2013-03-13 15:47:56	@EC	I do believe there is a bug in touch related to that
2013-03-13 15:48:06	@EC	That occurs while or shortly after you log in
2013-03-13 15:48:18	@EC	If the timing is right, your profile will not have been loaded
2013-03-13 15:48:22	@EC	But the history save timer fires
2013-03-13 15:48:31	@EC	And sends back to the server your empty (unloaded) history
2013-03-13 15:48:34	@EC	Overwriting it
2013-03-13 15:48:37	laserlemon	yikes. okay
2013-03-13 15:48:41	laserlemon	yup we were afraid of that
2013-03-13 15:48:45	laserlemon	(and still are)
2013-03-13 15:48:51	@EC	You’d have to check Jira, but I think the client team is aware of that issue
2013-03-13 15:49:07	@EC	If not, we should get it documented
2013-03-13 15:49:34	laserlemon	ok. i think i'm in the 90's as far as percentage now
2013-03-13 15:49:40	@EC	Whoops now 89
2013-03-13 15:49:41	laserlemon	should be enough to fumble through
2013-03-13 15:49:43	laserlemon	ha
2013-03-13 15:50:19	laserlemon	thanks for the explanation. we'll take what we have and patch it up real nice

2013-03-14 11:40:35	laserlemon	mshafer: ErsatzRyan and i can't seem to replicate the deadlock issue
2013-03-14 11:40:47	laserlemon	we could use a hand duplicating your workflow for that
2013-03-14 11:41:16	mshafer	I was able to if I made a bunch of Groups::TemporaryAssignment groups
2013-03-14 11:41:58	mshafer	seemed to be the easiest way to make it happen
2013-03-14 11:42:11	mshafer	I can look into it some more after I finish rebasing a few of my branches
2013-03-14 11:42:14	laserlemon	and then when you spin up the server, you're using foreman?
2013-03-14 11:42:18	laserlemon	sure
2013-03-14 11:43:51	mshafer	i spin up two servers manually
2013-03-14 11:44:28	laserlemon	manually, using "rails server" or "foreman start"?
2013-03-14 11:44:33	mshafer	rails server
2013-03-14 11:44:43	laserlemon	using webrick? thin?
2013-03-14 11:44:49	mshafer	webrick
2013-03-14 11:46:55	mshafer	the key is to have two running on different ports, and hit them at almost the same time.  It's a lot easier if you have production data to reproduce it (theres an observer that is pretty slow w/ production data)

2013-04-03 11:55:37	ErsatzRyan	EC: RE: AppleIp oneoff rake task issue.
2013-04-03 11:56:25	ErsatzRyan	The ones that are failing are invalid AppleIps
2013-04-03 11:57:17	ErsatzRyan	not a result of the rake task
2013-04-03 11:58:05	ErsatzRyan	if you were to `AppleIp.find` one of those id's that it lists and then ask it if it is `valid?` it would return false with or without the rake task
2013-04-03 12:04:04	@EC	greggroth: What’s your question?
2013-04-03 12:04:12	@EC	ErsatzRyan: So what should we do?
2013-04-03 12:05:58	ErsatzRyan	we could change the rake task to not check if they are valid and just save them sans validations or someone could make them valid prior to running the rake task
2013-04-03 12:06:54	@EC	ErsatzRyan: What’s the risk or negative impact to saving an invalid IP?
2013-04-03 12:07:00	ErsatzRyan	according to matt's comment the issue seems to be those AppleIps are not related to a stor or have an annotation
2013-04-03 12:07:05	@EC	They’re already in the database, right?
2013-04-03 12:07:12	ErsatzRyan	not that the IP info is incorret
2013-04-03 12:07:14	ErsatzRyan	incorrect
2013-04-03 12:07:39	@EC	Yes, we inherited a long list of unlabeled IPs
2013-04-03 12:07:47	@EC	No one’s really sure what stores they are for
2013-04-03 12:08:07	@EC	So when we brought that list into Intersect we added the requirement to label the IP
2013-04-03 12:08:10	ErsatzRyan	we didn't really anticipate that when writing the rake task and assumed prior to updating the range info they would be valid
2013-04-03 12:08:43	@EC	ErsatzRyan: Understood. So what are we risking if we save them without validations?
2013-04-03 12:09:08	@EC	What validations might we be circumventing?
2013-04-03 12:09:18	ErsatzRyan	we wouldn't be 100% sure that every one of them is that specific validation
2013-04-03 12:11:36	ErsatzRyan	the only validation I see that might be an issue is `must_be_unique_ip_range`
2013-04-03 12:11:42	@EC	What are the other validations we might be skipping?
2013-04-03 12:12:22	@EC	Which I’m guessing is just a custom validate_uniqueness_of-style-thing?
2013-04-03 12:13:12	ErsatzRyan	correct
2013-04-03 12:13:13	@EC	Seems like an acceptable risk. We wouldn’t be any worse off than we already are, anyway, right?
2013-04-03 12:13:21	@EC	Any others?
2013-04-03 12:14:48	ErsatzRyan	`must_be_valid_ip_address` (not affected), `must_be_unique_ip_range` (possible), `must_contain_store_or_annotation` (obvious offender), `must_not_change_ip_address_after_save` (not affected)
2013-04-03 12:14:55	ErsatzRyan	those are the only validations on the model
2013-04-03 12:18:29	ErsatzRyan	I think we'd be safe
2013-04-03 12:18:37	@EC	Since I know we don’t have enough information to go back and label the old IPs with correct annotations I think our best choice is to re-run the correction without validations
2013-04-03 12:18:57	ErsatzRyan	I'll update the rake task and make a PR after lunch
2013-04-03 12:19:12	@EC	We only need to do this once, right?
2013-04-03 12:19:22	ErsatzRyan	yeah
2013-04-03 12:19:29	@EC	I can just copy the task, alter it and run it from the console
2013-04-03 12:19:36	ErsatzRyan	ok
2013-04-03 12:19:57	@EC	Actually, because you’re closer to the problem, why don’t you do the altering.
2013-04-03 12:20:07	ErsatzRyan	the db columns for the ip_start/end were updated to the correct length, right?
2013-04-03 12:20:07	@EC	But we’ll just paste it into a gist and I’ll run from the console.
2013-04-03 12:20:12	@EC	yes

2013-04-03 12:20:30	greggroth	EC: so the question is do you have any feelings about me removing the publishable? method and letting the extra jobs get scheduled?
2013-04-03 12:20:34	@EC	Thanks for looking into it
2013-04-03 12:21:07	@EC	greggroth: Feelings? Probably not. But that was added after the initial implementation to solve a specific problem.
2013-04-03 12:21:18	@EC	greggroth: So we need to make sure we don’t re-introduce that.
2013-04-03 12:22:12	greggroth	how safe is it to assume that whoever fixed that problem added a test to reproduce it first?
2013-04-03 12:22:13	@EC	Let me see if I can find the original Pivotal Tracker story for you.
2013-04-03 12:22:18	@EC	heh
2013-04-03 12:22:21	greggroth	:-)
2013-04-03 12:22:22	@EC	50% safe
2013-04-03 12:22:46	@EC	Researching it now
2013-04-03 12:22:49	greggroth	I imagine it was introduced to reduce failing jobs.
2013-04-03 12:25:27	greggroth	There's also some logic in there for sending e-mails if `publishable?` raises an exception (which it should never raise)
2013-04-03 12:25:28	greggroth	https://code.apple.com/RetailSoftwareEngineering/intersect/blob/training/lib/publication/publication_ready_query.rb#L20
2013-04-03 12:25:58	@EC	I found the PT story for that one
2013-04-03 12:26:03	@EC	Had to do with tasks
2013-04-03 12:28:52	greggroth	`publishable?` on Task doesn't raise either: https://code.apple.com/RetailSoftwareEngineering/intersect/blob/training/app/models/creator/task.rb#L158
2013-04-03 12:29:34	greggroth	Also this query is used within a resque job, so if it raises the job will fail.
2013-04-03 12:30:17	greggroth	actaully ignore that thought -- was thinking about something else
2013-04-03 12:30:51	stevenharman	EC: for some context. We noticed that a few Documents had a `#publishable?` method which would delegate to various methods on their Intersect-side model. The logic they used varied (I think), but they were only used when querying for documents to publish.
2013-04-03 12:31:55	stevenharman	We are trying to remove that hard dependency/link of a Document to a model on the Intersect side. So my suggestion was to kill the publishable method and move the logic there into the respective publisher for that Document.
2013-04-03 12:33:18	stevenharman	The existing way has the effect of filtering those documents out of the "ready for pulication" collection. So I was suggesting delegating the decision of whether or not to publish a document based on the extra logic to the publisher itself. But Gregg asked, "why not just let the publish job fail?"
2013-04-03 12:33:29	stevenharman	To which I thought... indeed! And then he asked you.
2013-04-03 12:43:55	greggroth	EC  if you want to see what I have in mind, here is a PR: https://code.apple.com/RetailSoftwareEngineering/intersect/pull/494/files

2013-04-03 12:59:17	stevenharman	I suppose b/c there is nothing to translate?
2013-04-03 12:59:20	@EC	ErsatzRyan: Thanks. That was a fast lunch.
2013-04-03 13:33:18	@EC	Regarding: “The existing way has the effect of filtering those documents out of the ‘ready for pulication’ collection. So I was suggesting delegating the decision of whether or not to publish a document based on the extra logic to the publisher itself. But Gregg asked, ‘why not just let the publish job fail?’”
2013-04-03 13:33:46	@EC	greggroth stevenharman: The answer is “because the failure queue would be flooded, continuously, with publication failures”.

2013-04-03 13:34:02	@EC	Since we attempt to publish some things every 5 minutes.
2013-04-03 13:43:47	stevenharman	Instead we never know that they fail to publish?
2013-04-03 13:49:07	@EC	Instead, about 3 times a year we get an email every 5 minutes that opens a new support ticket and floods my inbox. Like the ones I got yesterday. =D
2013-04-03 13:49:42	@EC	Or the document doesn’t publish and the content creator contacts support to help figure out what went wrong
2013-04-03 13:50:17	@EC	I imagine the correct solution to this problem is to handle validations consistently
2013-04-03 13:50:33	@EC	And there’s a philosophical disagreement between client and server on how validations should be performed

2013-04-04 13:31:43	gaffneyc	EC: In your mail shortly
2013-04-04 13:31:47	@EC	stevenharman: I see you listed in the accounts under both “steven@highgroove.com” and “steveharman@gmail.com”
2013-04-04 13:31:54	@EC	gaffneyc: Thanks
2013-04-04 13:32:00	stevenharman	Hmm... in Jenkins?
2013-04-04 13:32:02	@EC	yep
2013-04-04 13:32:14	@EC	Password may be your Open Directory password
2013-04-04 13:32:20	@EC	Or may be something entirely unknown
2013-04-04 13:32:24	stevenharman	but to which account?
2013-04-04 13:32:35	stevenharman	Maybe we can get both of those killed and get a new one setup?
2013-04-04 13:33:09	@EC	Might be able to
2013-04-04 13:33:21	@EC	jankins.apple.com is going away as I understand it, though
2013-04-04 13:33:27	@EC	Can you sign in using either of those emails?
2013-04-04 13:33:52	stevenharman	let me try
2013-04-04 13:34:06	stevenharman	Hmm... just get a 404 now.
2013-04-04 13:34:12	stevenharman	Let me clear cookies for that sitge
2013-04-04 13:34:12	@EC	What URL
2013-04-04 13:34:19	stevenharman	http://jankins.apple.com/
2013-04-04 13:34:34	@EC	Weird
2013-04-04 13:34:42	@EC	Should be a sparse login page
2013-04-04 13:35:45	stevenharman	After clearing my cookies I saw the login.
2013-04-04 13:35:59	stevenharman	however, I can't log in with my current ODir password and either of those emails
2013-04-04 13:36:23	stevenharman	trying user: sharman + my current OpenDir passwork results in a 404.
2013-04-04 13:36:39	stevenharman	And then clearning my cookies gets me back to the login page.
2013-04-04 13:39:19	gaffneyc	EC: Need anything else from me before I leave?
2013-04-04 13:43:41	@EC	gaffneyc: Not that I can think of
2013-04-04 13:44:38	gaffneyc	If someone wants to test auto deploys to dev3 I've added the config options to the node definition.
2013-04-04 13:44:39	gaffneyc	https://code.apple.com/RetailSoftwareEngineering/chef/commit/5e87f33ba4d707fb8ae0c564a5947e5cfeccafa7
2013-04-04 13:45:06	gaffneyc	Just need someone with chef access (Evan) to change the definition and update the node on chef-server
2013-04-04 13:45:30	@EC	What do I need to do? Flip that to true?
2013-04-04 13:51:17	gaffneyc	Yeah
2013-04-04 13:51:35	gaffneyc	Flip it to true then update the node on chef-server
2013-04-04 13:51:49	gaffneyc	knife node update from file nodes/intersect-dev/intersect-dev3.json
2013-04-04 13:52:11	gaffneyc	I can enable it and do the first round of testing if you want
2013-04-04 13:52:22	gaffneyc	I've been able to test it locally with vagrant but not on a live server
2013-04-04 13:56:55	stevenharman	FYI: the client team is asking if we can run the Training Import for a few Lessons on the -dev3 box so they can make sure the re-worked GridItem::Content stuff works.
2013-04-04 13:57:10	stevenharman	I'm having eblair get me some IDs and then I'll run the migration for just those select Lessons.
2013-04-04 13:57:38	@EC	stevenharman: Okay
2013-04-04 13:57:48	@EC	stevenharman: This task publication logic is a bith
2013-04-04 13:57:49	@EC	bitch
2013-04-04 13:58:09	@EC	I remember why it’s confusing now
2013-04-04 13:58:11	stevenharman	yeah man... we have been arguing over what it "does" here too.
2013-04-04 13:58:50	@EC	lol
2013-04-04 14:01:27	@EC	Easy way to sort this out
2013-04-04 14:13:41	@EC	stevenharman: Do you know your LDAP account?
2013-04-04 14:13:54	@EC	It’s different than OD and AC
2013-04-04 14:13:57	stevenharman	I think so.
2013-04-04 14:13:59	@EC	Because at Apple, we like accounts
2013-04-04 14:14:05	stevenharman	1Password, to the rescue!
2013-04-04 14:16:09	stevenharman	Hmm... no dice
2013-04-04 14:16:19	stevenharman	Do I just use my username, or the full LDAP email?
2013-04-04 14:17:22	@EC	Full email
2013-04-04 14:18:26	stevenharman	Yeah, no dice.
2013-04-04 14:19:12	@EC	Can you sign in to webmail.apple.com using that username and password?
2013-04-04 14:22:24	greggroth	EC/stevenharman:  did you guys see my e-mail/PR?
2013-04-04 14:23:27	greggroth	I agree it's confusing.  I'm funning the full test suite now for my PR.
2013-04-04 14:23:29	@EC	greggroth: I did. Thank you. I’m sorting out the task publication logic myself to confirm for you and answer questions.
2013-04-04 14:23:33	greggroth	s/funning/running
2013-04-04 14:23:35	@EC	Oooo funning
2013-04-04 14:23:39	greggroth	:-)
2013-04-04 14:23:44	@EC	Sounds like a dessert.
2013-04-04 14:24:29	greggroth	If the features pass (the specs have already passed), I'm going to spend a minute improving the clarity of the TaskPublisher.
2013-04-04 14:24:37	greggroth	so far so good
2013-04-04 14:28:41	@EC	stevenharman: The answer to your question, “do projects ever publish?” is no. No they don’t.
2013-04-04 14:28:51	@EC	Due to circumstance rather than design.
2013-04-04 14:35:58	stevenharman	Well, that's... comforting?
2013-04-04 14:37:26	stevenharman	EC: I get:
2013-04-04 14:37:28	stevenharman	Unable to load https://webmailnew.apple.com/iwc/svc/iwcp/login.iwc status:400
2013-04-04 14:37:30	@EC	That’s…consistent, at least. =D
2013-04-04 14:37:36	stevenharman	When trying to log into webmail.
2013-04-04 14:37:40	@EC	Forgot about this issue. It’s been there since May 2011.
2013-04-04 14:37:50	@EC	Jesus.
2013-04-04 14:37:55	@EC	What is going on.
2013-04-04 14:52:27	stevenharman	EC: for the record, I reset my LDAP password, and can now log into webmail (via Safari... it fails in Chome).
2013-04-04 14:52:45	@EC	Okay, great.
2013-04-04 14:52:52	@EC	Then we know we’ve got the right credentials.
2013-04-04 14:53:02	@EC	Using those can you get into Jankins?
2013-04-04 14:53:10	stevenharman	Nope.
2013-04-04 14:57:17	@EC	Okay.
2013-04-04 14:57:31	@EC	Reply to Jesse and let him know the username and the response you get.
2013-04-04 15:00:22	stevenharman	OK.
2013-04-04 15:01:01	stevenharman	New topic... I was talking to eric and mentioned that they could be generating GUIDs for stuff, sending them to us, and then we could use those for IDs of Mongo docs. That is true, right?
2013-04-04 15:01:13	stevenharman	If so, we could drop this funky _storeKey business.
2013-04-04 15:01:37	stevenharman	He says he things it would be easy from his side, and it would be nice to kill that code from our side.
2013-04-04 15:01:51	stevenharman	I just stumbled back into it yesterday and got grumpy.
2013-04-04 15:02:08	stevenharman	I'd like to reduce the number of things-that-make-steven-grumpy in the code base. :)
2013-04-04 15:03:07	@EC	ha
2013-04-04 15:03:11	@EC	Yes on the grumpiness
2013-04-04 15:03:50	@EC	Yes, on the concept, too. Last I talked with Kennard we were in agreement about using a universally-unique identifier to talk about documents between server and client
2013-04-04 15:04:19	@EC	Where I may disagree is in the direct use of that identifier as the Mongo key
2013-04-04 15:04:25	@EC	Er…id
2013-04-04 15:05:00	@EC	Hesitant to couple those although I haven’t given it enough consideration.
2013-04-04 15:07:05	@EC	But, for example, keeping that unique identifier as an attribute of the document and presenting it to the client as its ID is a good improvement, IMO
2013-04-04 15:07:32	@EC	So clients don’t know that it is not the database key
2013-04-04 15:09:50	stevenharman	Yeah, we could do that too... so there is a DB key and then an "identifier". Though, with Mongo it's still just a GUID (bascially).
2013-04-04 15:11:48	@EC	Yeah. And using a client-generated identifier as the Mongo primary key *might* be okay but my instinct is to start with them separated and prove that they should be the same rather than the other way around.
2013-04-04 15:12:24	@EC	For one thing, you can’t trust any information coming from a client.
2013-04-04 15:12:35	@EC	The “client” could be a malicious user with curl.
2013-04-04 15:13:07	@EC	Another consideration is what happens if a future version of Mongo changes the behavior or usage of primary keys?
2013-04-04 15:13:08	stevenharman	Yeah... but how would letting them supply a GUID be any different.
2013-04-04 15:13:10	@EC	Stuff like that.
2013-04-04 15:13:22	@EC	It would be used by our application only.
2013-04-04 15:13:28	@EC	Instead of by the app and the database.
2013-04-04 15:14:07	stevenharman	Probably what we should have done was let them generate a :key and then kept our :id private.
2013-04-04 15:14:12	stevenharman	boom... done.
2013-04-04 15:14:17	@EC	I can’t articulate answers to these questions because I haven’t considered them carefully. I just know the questions to consider right now. =D
2013-04-04 15:14:34	@EC	Yep.
2013-04-04 15:14:50	@EC	We’ve already made the mistake of exposing our MySQL primary keys through the API.
2013-04-04 15:15:05	stevenharman	Yeah, everyone does that, it seems.
2013-04-04 15:15:12	@EC	And content creators have learned to use them as identifiers when communicating among each other.
2013-04-04 15:15:24	@EC	Yep.
2013-04-04 15:15:58	@EC	And then those primary keys made their way into item numbers. =S
2013-04-04 15:16:16	@EC	*Presented* to content creators as the way to refer to documents.
2013-04-04 15:16:37	@EC	Anyway…
2013-04-04 15:16:44	@EC	I’d love it if you explore that option.
2013-04-04 15:17:24	@EC	Please give those questions some close study.
2013-04-04 15:17:27	@EC	See what you think.
2013-04-04 15:18:58	stevenharman	would a different, "natural" key have been better? Is there one?
2013-04-04 15:19:18	stevenharman	a classic example is SSN. That is not a primary key, but only a natural key.
2013-04-04 15:20:24	stevenharman	as a human, I suppose your only primary key is your DNA - which makes the assumption that that doesn't mutate... So coming up with a generated "primary" key often makes sense as things natural keys are often not stable enough.
2013-04-04 15:24:53	@EC	stevenharman: That’s a thought.
2013-04-04 15:25:38	stevenharman	But do things like a Course or Lesson really have natural keys? Maybe...?
2013-04-04 15:25:46	@EC	stevenharman: Recent conversations suggest the natural key content creators are using amongst themselves and their business partners is the title.
2013-04-04 15:26:32	stevenharman	Yeah, that's also common. Think, GitHub. The repo name is a natural key. However, if it changes, your old references to that key are broken.
2013-04-04 15:26:49	@EC	Yep
2013-04-04 15:26:53	stevenharman	with GitHub the key is owner-name/repo-name
2013-04-04 15:26:59	stevenharman	but you get the point.
2013-04-04 15:27:03	@EC	Yep
2013-04-04 15:27:09	@EC	That’s a good example.
2013-04-04 15:27:32	stevenharman	For my little side app, brewdega.com, we use your usename as natural key, but have an id for your primary key.
2013-04-04 15:27:44	@EC	What I haven’t really studied enough is how does the need change when your primary client is not a human but another application.
2013-04-04 15:27:45	stevenharman	So you can go to brewdega.com/stevenharman to see my cellar.
2013-04-04 15:27:55	@EC	Which I will do now.
2013-04-04 15:28:21	@EC	OMG 404 not found
2013-04-04 15:28:42	stevenharman	oh... that's not actually the URL. the dev site is here: cellar.brewdega.com/stevenharman
2013-04-04 15:28:43	@EC	I can empathize with your earlier attempts at Web accessing.
2013-04-04 15:29:15	@EC	Wow. This your visual design, too?
2013-04-04 15:29:17	stevenharman	it's not live and that is just a staging environment which we wipe regularly.
2013-04-04 15:29:21	stevenharman	Yeah.
2013-04-04 15:29:24	@EC	It’s nice.
2013-04-04 15:29:45	stevenharman	It's got a long way to go. :)
2013-04-04 15:29:54	stevenharman	but thank you.
2013-04-04 15:30:13	@EC	Ohh you have Boundary Bay in there.
2013-04-04 15:30:16	@EC	Points.
2013-04-04 15:30:51	stevenharman	We have ~21.5K unique beers in there. http://cellar.brewdega.com/heartbeat
2013-04-04 15:31:43	@EC	Let me know when that’s released.
2013-04-04 15:31:47	@EC	I’ll use it.
2013-04-04 15:31:55	stevenharman	Will do.
2013-04-04 15:32:15	stevenharman	Are you also beer nerdy?

2013-04-05 13:34:32	@EC	I love it
2013-04-05 13:34:35	@EC	Seems about right
2013-04-05 13:41:35	greggroth	EC:  Thanks for decomposing #publish_to_intersect.  I believe the way I refactored task publication follows this same approach, but removes the unncessary forward-looking #publishable? checks.
2013-04-05 13:42:18	greggroth	If a task belongs to a project, it just goes straight to trying to publish that project rather than asking if the project is valid and deciding if it should be published or now.
2013-04-05 13:42:20	greggroth	*not
2013-04-05 13:42:56	greggroth	it makes the whole thing a lot simpler
2013-04-05 13:50:55	stevenharman	Per Eric B, Mentor Validations no longer need: zoomable, caption, nor images.
2013-04-05 13:51:04	stevenharman	"Old-world training had images on the validation, but the iOS client never used them, so we dropped them from the spec"
2013-04-05 13:51:11	stevenharman	Should we drop them too?
2013-04-05 13:56:44	stevenharman	EC: if you have a minute to consider ^
2013-04-05 13:59:14	@EC	stevenharman: I didn’t realize mentor validations ever had images supplied by the content creator. If the client doesn’t need them and there’s no interface in Mac to supply them then I don’t think the server needs them, either.
2013-04-05 14:00:24	stevenharman	I'd agree.
2013-04-05 14:04:15	stevenharman	I'm thinking I'll spin up a story in the Compass backlog to clean that up. Sound legit?

2013-04-08 16:28:21	stevenharman	Currently running the freshly-rebased Compass branch on my local CI.
2013-04-08 16:28:35	stevenharman	Once it's green, I'll push it to the GitHubs and deploy it to -dev3
2013-04-08 16:28:41	stevenharman	EC: is that legit? ^
2013-04-08 16:28:58	@EC	stevenharman: Yep.
2013-04-08 16:29:15	@EC	stevenharman: I forgot. Did Gaffney turn on auto-deploys for -dev3?
2013-04-08 16:35:48	stevenharman	Umm... not sure.
2013-04-08 16:36:08	stevenharman	I remember there being a lot of talk about that, but can't recall the decision.
2013-04-08 16:37:03	@EC	We’ll find out.
2013-04-08 16:37:12	stevenharman	I also just made this for you: https://code.apple.com/RetailSoftwareEngineering/intersect/pull/504
2013-04-08 17:01:48	-->	jonathanwallace (~jonathanw@17.153.105.238) has joined #rme-server
2013-04-08 17:47:38	@EC	lol
2013-04-08 17:47:41	@EC	For me?
2013-04-08 17:48:28	greggroth	EC:  I have some questions for you re: Creator::File
2013-04-08 17:48:47	@EC	Run!
2013-04-08 17:48:51	stevenharman	Just for whomever is integrating `next-release` these days (which I thought was still you.)
2013-04-08 17:49:07	@EC	stevenharman: Got it.
2013-04-08 17:49:20	greggroth	This commit added a `before_save` callback to create the intersect-side record (and copy attributes over):  https://code.apple.com/RetailSoftwareEngineering/intersect/commit/77cdbd67
2013-04-08 17:49:27	@EC	stevenharman: next-release is peer-managed like the long-running branches are now.
2013-04-08 17:49:38	@EC	Only thing I take care of is master.
2013-04-08 17:49:50	@EC	greggroth: Yep.
2013-04-08 17:50:04	greggroth	It seems odd to me to want the intersect model to exist without doing the full publication
2013-04-08 17:50:14	@EC	greggroth: Yep. :)
2013-04-08 17:50:23	@EC	greggroth: Thoughts why we might do that?
2013-04-08 17:50:32	greggroth	heh  nope
2013-04-08 17:50:33	greggroth	:-)
2013-04-08 17:50:38	@EC	Anyone?
2013-04-08 17:51:02	@EC	Item number.
2013-04-08 17:51:29	@EC	Remember how we coupled a document’s item number with its MySQL primary key?
2013-04-08 17:51:35	greggroth	rather I should say I don't know anything beyond the commit message: "Fixing links so they don't depend on publishing"
2013-04-08 17:51:54	greggroth	I haven't come accross that yet
2013-04-08 17:52:04	@EC	Launch RetailMe Mac and load the articles list.
2013-04-08 17:52:11	@EC	Or create and save a new article number.
2013-04-08 17:52:29	@EC	There’s a column, “Item number”, with something like “A000000”.
2013-04-08 17:52:37	@EC	The format is made up.
2013-04-08 17:52:53	@EC	The integer is the MySQL primary key, zero-padded.
2013-04-08 17:52:59	greggroth	Ah stevenharman just filled me in on "item number".  It's the intersect_id.  
2013-04-08 17:53:17	@EC	An item number is a reference identifier for content creators to use.
2013-04-08 17:53:22	@EC	Composed of the intersect ID.
2013-04-08 17:53:48	@EC	RME links also happen to be based on MySQL primary keys.
2013-04-08 17:54:19	@EC	So without a MySQL primary key for the published document you can’t use an item number to refer to a document nor link to your document from another document.
2013-04-08 17:54:33	@EC	Are we having fun yet?
2013-04-08 17:55:15	greggroth	How does the RetailMe app use "Item Number"?  
2013-04-08 17:55:32	@EC	Presently, for display to the content creator only.
2013-04-08 17:55:33	greggroth	It seems to me that since the file exists on the creator side, they can use that.
2013-04-08 17:55:39	@EC	Yes. 
2013-04-08 17:55:50	greggroth	urgh
2013-04-08 17:55:53	@EC	However, if I email you and ask you to copy-edit “The new iPad”
2013-04-08 17:56:02	@EC	And there have been 4 new iPads over time
2013-04-08 17:56:06	@EC	…
2013-04-08 17:56:13	greggroth	k
2013-04-08 17:56:18	@EC	I could instead email you and say “Will you copy edit A001231”?
2013-04-08 17:56:34	greggroth	i see.
2013-04-08 17:56:53	@EC	In reality, it does not appear to be a frequently-used feature.
2013-04-08 17:57:00	@EC	But it’s still there.
2013-04-08 17:57:48	@EC	The app also uses the primary key for linking
2013-04-08 17:57:54	@EC	Which is a separate use from item number
2013-04-08 17:58:03	@EC	But relies on the same piece (MySQL primary key)
2013-04-08 17:58:15	@EC	For example, if I create article A
2013-04-08 17:58:19	@EC	Then I create article B
2013-04-08 17:58:20	greggroth	I'll have to think about the best way to keep this feature in place while attempting to keep Creator::File ignorant of publication
2013-04-08 17:58:34	@EC	And I want to link the user to article A from B
2013-04-08 17:58:45	@EC	I may add text to B that says “Click here to go to A”.
2013-04-08 17:58:54	@EC	Using RetailMe Mac I can add a hyperlink
2013-04-08 17:59:01	@EC	Select document A as the destination
2013-04-08 17:59:15	@EC	And internally the app creates a link like: rme://news/articles/32
2013-04-08 17:59:20	@EC	Where 32 is the primary key of A
2013-04-08 17:59:25	greggroth	Ok.
2013-04-08 17:59:28	@EC	(The published representation of A)
2013-04-08 17:59:35	@EC	(Even if it hasn’t published yet)
2013-04-08 17:59:43	greggroth	right
2013-04-08 17:59:51	@EC	Fun yeah? :0
2013-04-08 17:59:56	greggroth	haha
2013-04-08 18:02:33	greggroth	I know how a good way to fix this, so I'll whip that up into a new PR.  
2013-04-08 18:02:38	greggroth	Thanks EC!
2013-04-08 18:02:47	@EC	np
2013-04-08 18:02:52	@EC	Thanks for checking on it.

2013-04-10 12:59:43	greggroth	EC:  While refactoring File publication, it looks like it is using a different localization fallback chain
2013-04-10 12:59:56	greggroth	for example, it expects fr-FR => en-FR => fr
2013-04-10 13:00:07	@EC	Yeahhh
2013-04-10 13:00:10	greggroth	and I'm pretty sure the standard is fr-FR => fr
2013-04-10 13:00:11	greggroth	right?
2013-04-10 13:00:18	@EC	There are actually about 3–4 fallback chains in Intersect
2013-04-10 13:00:33	@EC	Some of the explicit
2013-04-10 13:00:50	@EC	Some of the handled through publication logic
2013-04-10 13:00:54	@EC	*them
2013-04-10 13:01:09	@EC	Here’s an example
2013-04-10 13:01:14	@EC	The Download
2013-04-10 13:02:06	@EC	Should fall back as: fr-FR -> en-FR -> stop
2013-04-10 13:02:13	-->	stevenharman (~stevenhar@17.153.21.37) has joined #rme-server
2013-04-10 13:02:33	@EC	Because it is intended that you cannot view The Download of another country
2013-04-10 13:02:45	@EC	Since the content in that country may not be true in your country
2013-04-10 13:02:52	@EC	E.g. iPhone is on T-Mobile!
2013-04-10 13:02:57	@EC	Well…in the US
2013-04-10 13:03:01	@EC	But not in China
2013-04-10 13:03:06	greggroth	ok
2013-04-10 13:03:14	@EC	Whereas in materials or training
2013-04-10 13:03:34	@EC	It is intended that a copy of the file or lesson gets to you in the closest representation available
2013-04-10 13:03:43	@EC	Since the document should have the same content in all countries
2013-04-10 13:03:54	@EC	fr-FR, en-FR, fr, en
2013-04-10 13:04:19	@EC	Both rely on the Globalize fallback chain when coming out of the API headed to iPad
2013-04-10 13:04:41	@EC	Materials uses the Globalize fallback chain when producing the published representations (I believe)
2013-04-10 13:05:01	@EC	The Download manipulates the Globalize fallback chain when producing the published representations to effect its own fallback chain
2013-04-10 13:05:15	@EC	For example, it will produce an fr-FR and en-FR representation every time it publishes
2013-04-10 13:05:23	@EC	Even if there are no localizations or translations for FR
2013-04-10 13:05:44	greggroth	it looks like file implicity modifies the fallback chain via awkward conditionals
2013-04-10 13:05:56	@EC	It will produce a global representation and label it specifically as fr-FR and en-FR to ensure on the way out the API the user does not get out of their country
2013-04-10 13:06:26	greggroth	Do you know where The Download modified the Globalize fallback chain?  
2013-04-10 13:06:29	greggroth	I can't find it
2013-04-10 13:06:43	@EC	It doesn’t actually modify the fallback chain at all :)
2013-04-10 13:07:04	@EC	It manipulates it by inserting global representations under the guise of being a locale-specific representation
2013-04-10 13:07:43	greggroth	ok
2013-04-10 13:07:56	@EC	In other words, it knows if it sticks in a global representation under the locale “fr-FR” that any user asking for an fr-FR representation will be served a global representation preventing the fallback chain from every leaving FR
2013-04-10 13:07:58	@EC	Does that make sense?
2013-04-10 13:08:24	@EC	Well, not sense. But do you understand?
2013-04-10 13:08:52	greggroth	I think so.
2013-04-10 13:09:11	greggroth	I want to figure out if it's possible/feasible to modify the fallbacks per model.
2013-04-10 13:09:13	@EC	Does that shed light on your materials question?
2013-04-10 13:09:28	greggroth	It does -- it gives me something to look into.
2013-04-10 13:09:47	@EC	May I ask why we need to modify the fallbacks on a per-model basis?
2013-04-10 13:09:59	stevenharman	Is there a way we can harden those strategies up - pulling them into some sort of abstraction which can be applied, rather than implicity enforcing them in almost unnoticable ways, across the app?
2013-04-10 13:10:13	@EC	Yes, I imagine there is.
2013-04-10 13:10:29	@EC	I don’t think this is the time to do that, though.
2013-04-10 13:10:46	greggroth	There's some heavy conditionals that are essentially putting 'en-FR' into the fallback chain and I think it would be better to make that explicit
2013-04-10 13:10:47	greggroth	https://code.apple.com/RetailSoftwareEngineering/intersect/blob/compass/app/models/creator/file.rb#L142
2013-04-10 13:11:04	@EC	Separating the publication, localization and translation modules from each other is a hefty change already.

2013-04-10 13:11:24	@EC	I’d prefer to do the absolute minimum to separate them and no more.
2013-04-10 13:11:24	greggroth	that conditional is a mess and is difficult to understand.  It's making refactoring a pain.
2013-04-10 13:12:48	@EC	After we’ve achieved separation and hardened the refactored code we can back around for the next improvement.
2013-04-10 13:13:11	@EC	^come
2013-04-10 13:14:21	@EC	greggroth: Yep, I see what’s going on. Took a long time to get there, though. That is confusing.
2013-04-10 13:14:53	greggroth	I can pull it out into private methods for the time being
2013-04-10 13:15:26	@EC	I think I understand what you’re asking, stevenharman
2013-04-10 13:15:54	@EC	In greggroth’s case you’re asking if that highlighted logic can be turned into a model of its own?
2013-04-10 13:16:14	stevenharman	Yeah... into some form of discrete "thing"
2013-04-10 13:16:19	stevenharman	with a name.
2013-04-10 13:16:30	@EC	Totally. That makes a lot of sense here.
2013-04-10 13:17:00	@EC	What I want to avoid is literally changing the Globalize fallback chain implementation.
2013-04-10 13:17:09	stevenharman	I don't know what that would look like, but unifiying all of the strategies we use for determining fallbacks, giving them names, and an eplicit way to "apply" them would be helpful. At least, I suspect so.
2013-04-10 13:17:21	@EC	Yep. I agree.
2013-04-10 13:17:31	@EC	Let’s tackle them one at a time, though.
2013-04-10 13:17:37	stevenharman	Sure...
2013-04-10 13:17:40	@EC	Rather than trying to find and extract them all at once.
2013-04-10 13:18:09	stevenharman	Yeah, I'm down with that.

2013-04-15 14:35:25	stevenharman	We realized the ruby version was wrong b/c we have a new guy coming onto this project and he was using the README as a guide to get set up.

2013-04-16 13:36:24	laserlemon	EC: have a couple questions for you
2013-04-16 13:36:45	@EC	Are they the questions you left in-story?
2013-04-16 13:36:53	laserlemon	wondering whether you've had time to consider the base-36 language/country digits in materials file short codes
2013-04-16 13:37:08	@EC	Not really
2013-04-16 13:37:10	laserlemon	ok
2013-04-16 13:37:15	@EC	This week is going to be all about the training project for me
2013-04-16 13:37:35	@EC	My gut reaction is the base-36 thing is just kicking the can down the road
2013-04-16 13:37:36	laserlemon	ok. in that case, who should i bother about the iworld locale for Portuguese?
2013-04-16 13:37:42	@EC	But would work

2013-04-16 13:38:04	@EC	Since there’s the Mexico slot
2013-04-16 13:38:26	laserlemon	would you prefer we go the mexico route?

2013-04-22 12:27:52	@EC	Request for review: https://code.apple.com/RetailSoftwareEngineering/intersect/pull/537
2013-04-22 12:41:56	@EC	greggroth: How did that go?
2013-04-22 12:42:23	@EC	greggroth: I think I’m going to be able to resolve the issue I was encountering by rewriting a little bit of code in GoLiveLanguage
2013-04-22 12:42:57	@EC	So that it builds new relation members rather than trying to replace the relation which triggers a save and causes those path problems
2013-04-22 12:49:31	jonathanwallace	reviewed and merged #537
2013-04-22 13:01:35	greggroth	I haven't been able to reproduce the empty-string-as-a-key bug in your test app.
2013-04-22 13:02:09	greggroth	EC ^
2013-04-22 13:02:39	@EC	Can you reproduce it if you remove your patch?
2013-04-22 13:05:48	@EC	greggroth: Think I just found a variation of that Mongoid bug
2013-04-22 13:06:44	greggroth	Following your steps on the github issue, I don't get any failures.
2013-04-22 13:06:54	@EC	If you try to #clear or #destroy_all on the relation of a third-level document before the second-level document is attached to the root document it will throw a NoMethodError
2013-04-22 13:06:54	greggroth	It does the insertion fine and the query looks right.
2013-04-22 13:07:07	@EC	Without your patch?
2013-04-22 13:07:09	greggroth	right
2013-04-22 13:07:14	@EC	What version of Mongo?
2013-04-22 13:07:20	greggroth	with `gem 'mongoid', '2.4.2'
2013-04-22 13:07:23	greggroth	`
2013-04-22 13:07:30	@EC	Reload the document and re-examine it
2013-04-22 13:07:36	@EC	Or view it in Mongo
2013-04-22 13:07:45	@EC	(Which is even better)
2013-04-22 13:08:06	@EC	2.0.4 throws an exception, 2.4.2 completes the query but writes the data incorrectly
2013-04-22 13:08:25	@EC	Mongoid paired with, that is
2013-04-22 13:08:29	greggroth	MONGODB (0.1ms) test['trains'].insert([{"_id"=>BSON::ObjectId('517558696af64e08e0000001')}])

2013-04-22 13:08:49	greggroth	thats from the log
2013-04-22 13:08:57	@EC	Trains don’t have seats :)
2013-04-22 13:09:09	greggroth	seats is on teh cars
2013-04-22 13:09:18	@EC	And on the root
2013-04-22 13:09:26	@EC	That first set
2013-04-22 13:09:31	greggroth	oh woa
2013-04-22 13:09:35	@EC	Yeah
2013-04-22 13:09:40	greggroth	you're right.
2013-04-22 13:09:43	@EC	Awesome, huh?
2013-04-22 13:09:43	greggroth	interesting.
2013-04-22 13:10:44	@EC	With Mongo 2.0.4 you just get lots of exceptions. Which is better than 2.4.2 where you just get lots of bad data successfully persisted.
2013-04-22 13:11:29	@EC	Which also makes me very nervous that some of our green tests could be persisting bad things
2013-04-22 13:11:44	greggroth	when i switch mongoid to use my local (patched) version, it behaves as expected
2013-04-22 13:11:54	@EC	Okay cool
2013-04-22 13:11:54	greggroth	MONGODB (0.1ms) test['trains'].update({"_id"=>BSON::ObjectId('51755cd26af64e7baf000008')}, {"$set"=>{"cars"=>[{"_id"=>BSON::ObjectId('51755cd56af64e7baf000009'), "seats"=>[{"_id"=>BSON::ObjectId('51755cd56af64e7baf00000a')}, {"_id"=>BSON::ObjectId('51755cd56af64e7baf00000b')}]}], "seats"=>[{"_id"=>BSON::ObjectId('51755cd56af64e7baf00000a')},
2013-04-22 13:11:54	greggroth	{"_id"=>BSON::ObjectId('51755cd56af64e7baf00000b')}]}})
2013-04-22 13:12:03	@EC	So it’s broken without your patch and fixed with?
2013-04-22 13:12:15	greggroth	oh wait
2013-04-22 13:12:21	greggroth	it has two "seats" keys
2013-04-22 13:12:27	@EC	You have two cars
2013-04-22 13:12:32	@EC	Looks right
2013-04-22 13:12:46	greggroth	*having a hard time reading*
2013-04-22 13:12:51	@EC	:)
2013-04-22 13:13:30	greggroth	I'll comment on the issue with this information
2013-04-22 13:13:59	greggroth	It may not be the *right* fix, but it's something.
2013-04-22 13:16:04	jonathanwallace	have you tried the full mongoid test suite with your fix?
2013-04-22 13:18:06	greggroth	I'll try it now
2013-04-22 13:25:37	greggroth	tests are green.  I'll look into writing a test for this and making a pull request.

2013-05-06 12:09:18	laserlemon	EC: it was great! good to be back though
2013-05-06 12:09:56	@EC	Is the conference posting videos of the sessions?

2013-05-06 12:31:39	@EC	I tried to resolve the conflicts but I’m not sure what is being replaced and what is just additional
2013-05-06 12:31:47	@EC	Would you mind rebasing it for me?
2013-05-06 12:31:52	@EC	On next-release?
2013-05-06 12:33:57	laserlemon	it was cut off of next-release
2013-05-06 12:34:10	laserlemon	has next-release moved this morning?
2013-05-06 12:34:37	laserlemon	EC: ^
2013-05-06 12:34:57	@EC	Not to my knowledge
2013-05-06 12:35:08	@EC	559 is the gem change, not the test failures
2013-05-06 12:35:22	@EC	It’s the one from last week
2013-05-06 12:35:35	laserlemon	yeah it's up to date. 2 commits ahead of next-release
2013-05-06 12:35:54	@EC	Hmm
2013-05-06 12:36:01	@EC	Okay let me reexamine
2013-05-06 12:36:26	laserlemon	wait, i think we're talking about different PRs
2013-05-06 12:36:27	laserlemon	sorry
2013-05-06 12:36:30	laserlemon	EC: ^
2013-05-06 12:36:38	laserlemon	i was talking about 571

2013-05-06 12:37:21	@EC	If you would, please
2013-05-06 12:37:28	@EC	I started to do so to integrate it
2013-05-06 12:37:36	@EC	But I was uncertain about some of the conflicts
2013-05-06 12:37:50	laserlemon	ok ryan and i will work on it

2013-05-06 13:42:36	@EC	Worth exploring
2013-05-06 13:42:59	@EC	1) See what impact the change has on the test suite
