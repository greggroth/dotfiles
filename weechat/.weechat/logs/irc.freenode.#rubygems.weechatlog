2013-01-30 12:57:30	qrush_	and the first intrusion we've ever had since i got involved
2013-01-30 12:57:35	mephux	qrush_: that you know of

2013-01-30 12:58:12	bradland	so we can consider the S3 last modified data as certain
2013-01-30 12:58:19	mephux	bradland: ok
2013-01-30 12:58:25	postmodern	qrush_, to help dispel FUD around this, I'm going to post the PoC officially
2013-01-30 12:58:27	mephux	thats a good place to start then
2013-01-30 12:58:36	postmodern	qrush_, is there a CVE for this yet, since other people run gemcutter?
2013-01-30 12:58:38	qrush_	postmodern: it already is posted?
2013-01-30 12:58:40	mephux	honestly at this point all popular gems should be cut off
2013-01-30 12:58:54	postmodern	qrush_, magnus holm posted a copy
2013-01-30 12:59:11	mephux	who knows how many other apps would already owned from bundle install - fucking terrifying
2013-01-30 12:59:28	qrush_	mephux: how would that happen?
2013-01-30 12:59:34	qrush_	if the S3 keys were not expoed?
2013-01-30 12:59:36	qrush_	*exposed.
2013-01-30 12:59:46	titanous	we don't know anything at this point
2013-01-30 12:59:51	titanous	other than a vulnerability existed
2013-01-30 12:59:55	mephux	qrush_: easy, modify the gem - and have it netcat -p 9000 -l
2013-01-30 12:59:57	benchMark	We don't know if they were exposed.
2013-01-30 13:00:01	funcuddles	qrush, were they on the box?
2013-01-30 13:00:03	benchMark	Realistically.
2013-01-30 13:00:05	mephux	alow remote access and then priv up
2013-01-30 13:00:06	postmodern	titanous, existed for since 1.9.2
2013-01-30 13:00:15	benchMark	The payload could have easily allowed remote access instead of what it did.
2013-01-30 13:00:36	funcuddles	do we know when the actual hack happened?
2013-01-30 13:00:36	 *	qrush_ is feeling extremely overwhelmed
2013-01-30 13:00:40	funcuddles	do you know how long they were on the box?
2013-01-30 13:00:56	funcuddles	did they drop some script that iterated through s3 and modify key gems?
2013-01-30 13:01:06	funcuddles	that's why you shoudl be doing forensics
2013-01-30 13:01:10	qrush_	postmodern: I haven't thought of making a CVE, but wouldnt that mean any OSS rails app would need one?
2013-01-30 13:01:15	funcuddles	instead of just deleting the box and starting over
2013-01-30 13:01:35	postmodern	qrush_, no, just for people who run gemcutter, so they can update or take evasive actions

2013-01-30 13:02:32	bradland	qrush_: i feel you man. keep this in mind. there are a few guys in here who know security pretty well. IMO, a wise thing to do at this point would be to select some individuals from the channel who are volunteering and seem to have a good background. Do some vetting, and get them involved in a deeper way. I'm nominating postmodern and mephux.
2013-01-30 13:02:43	postmodern	funcuddles, so i think checking S3 timestamps is a good start, checking if gems were yanked/deleted might also be a good idea
2013-01-30 13:03:00	###	qrush_ is now known as qrush
2013-01-30 13:03:00	bradland	and fun cuddles, for that matter
2013-01-30 13:04:27	bradland	1) ensure that no attacker has continued access
2013-01-30 13:04:43	mephux	bradland is right - select a few people.. jump on a call and work.. i'm down to dedicate my day.. this is important
2013-01-30 13:04:50	postmodern	or we could write up a serious of questions, like a check list
2013-01-30 13:05:04	mephux	postmodern: good idea
2013-01-30 13:05:06	evan	hi guys
2013-01-30 13:05:28	evan	I did a first level hand audit of the processes and filesystem
2013-01-30 13:05:52	evan	Nothing at this points to anyone running any processes nor putting any files down
2013-01-30 13:06:00	chort0	as an incident responder, i recommend the following steps: 1) create full image of memory and save it directly to non-local storage (network mount, removable drive, etc), 2) shutdown system, 3) make bit-for-bit copy of the local storage, 4) restore from backups, keep gem download function off-line until investigation completes.
2013-01-30 13:06:04	@raggi	evan: :)
2013-01-30 13:06:24	chort0	you won't know the extent of the compromise until someone analyses the memory and disk images
2013-01-30 13:06:25	evan	we have the entire attack vector due to the how it was explioted

2013-01-30 13:07:14	@raggi	evan: you can use the package manager for this too, not sure what mechanisms you're using
2013-01-30 13:07:24	@raggi	mephux: people can add --local temporarily, if they're using bundler
2013-01-30 13:07:30	@raggi	as long as they dont' update, they'll be fine
2013-01-30 13:07:34	mephux	raggi: word
2013-01-30 13:07:35	chort0	mephux: is that worse than every rails deploy being trojan'd?
2013-01-30 13:07:54	mephux	chort0: both are bad.. trust me.. i agree with you.. that was my first suggestion
2013-01-30 13:08:01	@raggi	mephux: if they have updated, they can scp up a gem from localhost, and gem install it, then --local will work again
2013-01-30 13:08:13	mephux	raggi: thats a good workaround
2013-01-30 13:08:21	@raggi	mephux: ofc, they mostly suffer capistrano disease, with remote builds, rather than single-builds
2013-01-30 13:08:28	benchMark	I _think_ we should have a pretty good idea if anybody did anything nefarious just looking for !ruby blocks that aren't specifically gem related in the manifests, right?
2013-01-30 13:08:36	qrush	benchMark: yes
2013-01-30 13:08:38	hone	qrush: cool. can you ping me when you want me to do things on bundler-api?
2013-01-30 13:08:40	chort0	given the choice between some limited downtime and potential cascading compromises, you should choose the downtime
2013-01-30 13:08:43	qrush	hone: sure
2013-01-30 13:09:18	evan	hi everyone
2013-01-30 13:09:20	chort0	and i'll remind you that you don't know whether the attacker was just proving a point or whether they were actually trojaning packages until you do the analysis
2013-01-30 13:09:26	qrush	i think taking down access to *all* gems and the buckets is a real overreaction

2013-01-30 13:09:57	chort0	qrush: you can't PROVE they're all safe
2013-01-30 13:10:01	benchMark	FWIW, we immediately disabled all deploys of our code until we're confident that there wasn't a real compromise.
2013-01-30 13:10:02	titanous	I don't think it's an overreaction at all
2013-01-30 13:10:05	evan	but let's not let our imaginations run away with ourselves just yet
2013-01-30 13:10:09	chort0	if you can't prove they're safe, you have to assume they're not
2013-01-30 13:10:09	titanous	it's the sane thing to do
2013-01-30 13:10:11	benchMark	Because I agree that it's not an overreaction.

2013-01-30 13:13:49	evan	please don't dogpile on qrush
2013-01-30 13:13:59	evan	he's under a lot of stress from this and work
2013-01-30 13:14:05	evan	we understand what you guys are saying
2013-01-30 13:14:06	postmodern	mephux, well qrush has already deleted some of the data, so I would just do a scortch and burn policy
2013-01-30 13:14:13	mephux	evan: understood - but this is no time for emotion.
2013-01-30 13:14:14	postmodern	mephux, reset the VM, and audit the gems in S3
2013-01-30 13:14:21	evan	it's not a Vm.
2013-01-30 13:14:29	evan	so it's not resetable.
2013-01-30 13:14:30	samkottler	seriously, just let evan and qrush get this done and then reevaluate
2013-01-30 13:14:31	postmodern	evan, reset the system, whatever
2013-01-30 13:14:34	qrush	we do have finely grained control over what gems are indexed. What if we quickly verified the *latest* version of all gems, then *all* versions of the top 100, then top 1000 gems. Then everything?
2013-01-30 13:14:48	postmodern	evan, dd a new image onto the HD and reboot, whatever floats your boat

2013-01-30 13:53:32	evan	then we'll turn around and validate the list against the DB
2013-01-30 13:53:38	bradland	*ask
2013-01-30 13:53:42	funcuddles	do we know how long the hackers were there?
2013-01-30 13:53:44	evan	so that we can see any changes that occured oddly
2013-01-30 13:53:55	funcuddles	btw, here's a scary example of what could have happened: http://kerneltrap.org/node/1584
2013-01-30 13:53:56	evan	funcuddles: nothing points to them having shell access
2013-01-30 13:53:58	qrush	too bad we dont keep a SHA of the gemfiles on the rubygems table :(
2013-01-30 13:54:09	raz	it may be too early to ask but are you considering to make -P HighSecurity the default after this?
2013-01-30 13:54:21	bradland	qrush: couldn't be trusted anyway
2013-01-30 13:54:39	mephux	and that funcuddles is why security people care :( lets hope that didn';t happen here.
2013-01-30 13:54:39	evan	raz: thats a discussion for another day.
2013-01-30 13:54:42	bradland	the S3 modified date is the savior here; it can't be mucked with
2013-01-30 13:54:50	evan	bradland: right
2013-01-30 13:54:58	evan	we'll be able to use that as a validator
2013-01-30 13:55:26	raz	evan: ok, understandable. however it might aid in a clean cut (delete all the things, force everyone to re-push signed gem)

2013-01-30 13:55:52	mephux	funcuddles: agree
2013-01-30 13:55:54	funcuddles	we all know incident responders
2013-01-30 13:55:57	bradland	that's probably the biggest concern i have right now
2013-01-30 13:55:59	funcuddles	one guy in here is one
2013-01-30 13:56:14	funcuddles	looka t how subtle that kernel backdoor from 2003 was, they almost looked over it
2013-01-30 13:56:22	bradland	with all due respect, evan, we don't have any insight in to how you analyzed the box for active intrusions, so we can't develop a good level of confidence
2013-01-30 13:56:23	funcuddles	hackers are not retarded
2013-01-30 13:56:36	evan	bradland: thats totally true.
2013-01-30 13:56:49	mephux	bradland: i agree, it's one thing to say.. 'Ok, it's all good' vs proving it
2013-01-30 13:56:51	mephux	:(
2013-01-30 13:56:52	evan	but here is the thing
2013-01-30 13:57:00	bradland	i get the pragmatic argument
2013-01-30 13:57:02	evan	we completely understand the initial vector
2013-01-30 13:57:04	qrush	Ruby deploys are now disabled on Heroku - https://status.heroku.com/incidents/489
2013-01-30 13:57:17	mephux	in this case.. people wil ldemand evidence.. just my thoughts
2013-01-30 13:57:21	evan	we can use the s3 logs and objects to be able to see all the code they ran
2013-01-30 13:57:32	bradland	you can use the S3 logs to identify changes
2013-01-30 13:57:33	qrush	evan: can we make the files bucket public?
2013-01-30 13:57:39	evan	if we find code in there that introduced shell code
2013-01-30 13:57:40	benchMark	We should be able to find the payload in the S3 objects, yes.
2013-01-30 13:57:43	bradland	you can't use that to determine whether there are active intrusions
2013-01-30 13:57:44	evan	then we take it to that level
2013-01-30 13:57:50	evan	but we because we ca do that
2013-01-30 13:57:51	benchMark	And we should have the logs to show us if any of those objects were changed/deleted.
2013-01-30 13:57:51	evan	we should
2013-01-30 13:58:00	chort0	please take a memory image of the box asap
2013-01-30 13:58:10	evan	chort0: ok
2013-01-30 13:58:14	chort0	that is one thing that is very important and gets less trustworthy over time
2013-01-30 13:58:27	chort0	if the attacker has access or has cron/at jobs, etc
2013-01-30 13:58:27	raz	chort0: wouldn't it be more sensible to re-install from scratch on a new box?
2013-01-30 13:58:37	chort0	they could clean up their backdoors
2013-01-30 13:58:44	chort0	also if the box is rebooted, it's lost
2013-01-30 13:58:53	chort0	raz: no
2013-01-30 13:59:00	chort0	first take the memory image, THEN shutdown
2013-01-30 13:59:03	bradland	you can't rely on an audit of the current S3 data to tell you whether a gem was ever compromised (historically), because this is an arbitrary code execution issue
2013-01-30 13:59:05	bradland	they can run any ruby
2013-01-30 13:59:09	chort0	then take disk image
2013-01-30 13:59:16	chort0	can restore to a clean box in parallel
2013-01-30 13:59:25	chort0	but things need to happen in specific order to not lose artifacts
2013-01-30 13:59:25	raz	ah you're after forensics
2013-01-30 13:59:28	chort0	yes
2013-01-30 13:59:33	raz	i was thinking more about getting back running :)
2013-01-30 13:59:37	bradland	you can only see what was modified recently, and reconcile that to determine if any popular gems are (likely) compromised
2013-01-30 13:59:38	@drbrain	evan: I can verify gems up to about two months ago against my clone of the repository
2013-01-30 13:59:53	evan	drbrain: do it.
2013-01-30 14:00:00	chort0	raz: i can understand wanting to get up and running quickly, but shutting the box down destroys valuable clues
2013-01-30 14:00:07	qrush	drbrain: https://gist.github.com/4674633
2013-01-30 14:00:10	qrush	thats the last month
2013-01-30 14:00:10	bradland	IMO, this is being worked from the wrong direction. looking for evidence of tampering only tells you if things have been tampered right now.
2013-01-30 14:00:15	evan	hey guys
2013-01-30 14:00:24	 *	raz agrees with bradland
2013-01-30 14:00:27	evan	I'll say that the next level for this is going to be to move all of rubygems.org to a new machine
2013-01-30 14:00:36	evan	but I'm not going to do that in a rush today
2013-01-30 14:00:44	evan	but that is on the list.

2013-01-30 14:03:53	raz	evan: hm, another idea just crossed my mind. how about (after recovery) making '-P HighSecurity' the default, and allow new gem pushes only in signed form?  worried users could then just refrain from installing gems from the current (unsigned) pool.

There's drbrain comparing using his local copy, but as bradland points out, there's a large time window during which something malicious could have been done including replacing legitimate gems locally with compromised versions.
2013-01-30 14:15:33	envygeeks	@evan Try to create a different size and see if it fixes the problem, no joke when we provision a lot of servers at once we sometimes have to do that for some odd reason

2013-01-30 14:17:47	wlll	raggi: what if the metadata in a gem was not touched?
2013-01-30 14:17:55	bradland	will: there are some data points that can be used to sniff out suspicious data. for example, the rubygems database will contain data about the datetime a gem was pushed. the S3 modified date cannot be changed (because it's only accessible through the S3 API), so that can be used to smell test gem data.

2013-01-30 15:30:33	raz	what i'd like to see is the md5-validation finished (as good as possible) and rubygems come up on a freshly installed server, with gem/bundler enforcing signed gems by default. that way gem authors are encouraged to re-push signed versions of their gems ASAP, and users can still choose to install old versions by overriding -P.

2013-01-30 15:31:17	bradland	the_mentat: i think it was mephux. i can't really tell from my transcript.
2013-01-30 15:31:19	chort0	raz: but memory dump has to be done before the info is lost forever. maybe doesn't need to be *analyzed* immediately, but a dump needs to be taken and saved off-line to removed storage
2013-01-30 15:31:36	the_mentat	bradland makes sense, thx
2013-01-30 15:31:49	mephux	whats up?
2013-01-30 15:31:51	raz	chort0: sure, it may be academically interesting. it doesn't help to get rubygems running again (and in a more secure fashion).
2013-01-30 15:32:05	chort0	uhh, you're missing the point big time
2013-01-30 15:32:09	jcran	mephux: where did you source those 6 gems you linked on dropbox?
2013-01-30 15:32:15	bradland	mephux: do you know if evan ever got the memory dump in the hands of HIDS expert?
2013-01-30 15:32:16	chort0	there's no way to know what the attacker did without taking the memory dump immediately

2013-01-30 15:32:33	chort0	you can come back later and validate gems, you can't come back later and dump memory, because it's gone
2013-01-30 15:32:34	mephux	bradland: not that i know of.
2013-01-30 15:32:40	mephux	jcran: here
2013-01-30 15:32:51	bradland	ok, looks like only evan can answer the memory dump question. we'll have to wait for him.
2013-01-30 15:32:54	nzkoz	qrush: s3's etags are md5s, so you can do one bulk crawl fetching all the last-modified and md5s for every single gem, someone should be doing that, and then wait on evan for the rest
2013-01-30 15:33:14	nzkoz	qrush: you should also be starting over with brand new hardware, new AMIs (assuming yours were custom built)
2013-01-30 15:33:15	@raggi	nzkoz: we're running sha checks
2013-01-30 15:33:18	raz	chort0: it's not very interesting what the attacker did. the box is compromised and gems _may_ be compromised. it's unlikely the mem-dump will provide useful information about that - and even if it does there's no way to know whether that info is complete.
2013-01-30 15:33:24	nzkoz	raggi: but why bother, s3 has done that for you
2013-01-30 15:33:30	qrush	benchMark: can puf do that ^ ?
2013-01-30 15:33:33	bradland	nzkoz: server is not a VM (it's bare metal)
2013-01-30 15:33:34	nzkoz	md5 vs sha is academic at this point
2013-01-30 15:33:37	@raggi	nzkoz: s3 is the one that's pwnt
2013-01-30 15:33:45	@raggi	nzkoz: i agree, benchMark chose sha512
2013-01-30 15:33:47	@raggi	but meh
2013-01-30 15:33:47	chort0	raz: you can't prove the gems are safe if you don't know what the attacker did. if they had local access they could tamper with anything
2013-01-30 15:33:49	@raggi	doesn't matter
2013-01-30 15:33:55	@raggi	it's only 300k files
2013-01-30 15:34:05	benchMark	I chose sha512 because I didn't feel like arguing about whether md5 was good enough.
2013-01-30 15:34:09	chort0	you also can't prove attacker doesn't have continuing access to s3 if you don't know if they dropped a rootkit, had a reverse shell open, etc
2013-01-30 15:34:09	nzkoz	raggi: it does matter, you only have to md5sum *trusted* files, then compare against s3 without refreshing
2013-01-30 15:34:13	benchMark	So I went in the extreme other direction.
2013-01-30 15:34:16	nzkoz	but whatever, so long as that's happening
2013-01-30 15:34:18	@raggi	chort0: why don't you write up all the possible vectors you can think of in a gist
2013-01-30 15:34:21	benchMark	I can happily md5sum them all.
2013-01-30 15:34:27	@raggi	chort0: and then write up checks against them alongside
2013-01-30 15:34:30	@raggi	chort0: and we can check them off
2013-01-30 15:34:34	benchMark	I'm not sure we have a set of trusted files though.
2013-01-30 15:34:37	@raggi	instead of dropping it all here
2013-01-30 15:34:39	raz	chort0: exactly. that's why they compare gems to assumed-good versions, and will hopefully relaunch with all gems marked as "tainted" (by defaulting to requiring signed gems).
2013-01-30 15:34:48	chort0	i'm not even talking about the checks right now, i'm talking about CAPTURING the evidence
2013-01-30 15:34:59	chort0	if you trample all over the crime scene, you'll never get the evidence
2013-01-30 15:35:11	chort0	can't discuss what to look for until you have the evidence captured
2013-01-30 15:35:13	danp_	we are working on coming up with a checksum corpus based on pushed apps
2013-01-30 15:35:13	@raggi	chort0: evan started a memory dump, but this is all theoretical at this point,s o please write it all

2013-01-30 15:54:54	qrush	chort0: nice, but i'm not sure what here is applicable. it's pretty obvious we need to reset the box at this point
2013-01-30 15:55:09	benchMark	Need to replace the box, really.
2013-01-30 15:55:48	raz	ideally you'd re-install to a fresh set of boxes (unrelated to the ones you have now)

2013-01-30 15:56:48	raz	chort0: the box will be wiped clean (formatted). what happened on there is really only of forensic interest, and they already pulled the mem-dump i think, so this point can be marked as done.
2013-01-30 15:56:52	chort0	also note that simply capturing the info isn't a commitment to analyzing it ever. it just means it's possible

2013-01-30 15:57:20	chort0	if you don't capture the memory and later wish you had, well too bad. if you do capture the memory and dont' do anything with it, no harm done

2013-01-30 16:52:21	xorrbit	I know you guys are in response mode right now but are there any thoughts on requiring gem maintainers to start signing gems or anything like that?
2013-01-30 16:52:22	@raggi	mephux: what do you propose?
2013-01-30 16:52:25	@evan	but in the effort to use evidence rather than jump to conclusions
2013-01-30 16:52:28	@evan	we should do so
2013-01-30 16:52:35	@evan	we understand the initial attack vector
2013-01-30 16:52:37	mephux	raggi: i think evan is doing a good job.
2013-01-30 16:52:46	@evan	and thus we need to validate that vector as wide as we can
2013-01-30 16:52:46	bradland	xorrbit: that's been discussed a few times
2013-01-30 16:52:57	raz	xorrbit: has been proposed (by myself and other people), discussion was postponed until the immediate issue is sorted
2013-01-30 16:53:00	bradland	there will likely be a follow up to this given its reach
2013-01-30 16:53:00	@evan	benchMark's first pass of not finding any other gem exploiting the bug was step 1
2013-01-30 16:53:09	mephux	raggi: the only thing i would add is doing some forensics. or hading it over to some experts so we can claim everyhting that could be done was done

2013-01-30 16:53:16	xorrbit	cool, great work and carry on
2013-01-30 16:53:17	mephux	without seeing anything touched
2013-01-30 16:53:19	@evan	if I can prove that the exploit was not otherwise used
2013-01-30 16:53:30	@evan	then I can prove that there is no attacker shell access
2013-01-30 16:53:34	@raggi	mephux: sure, if someone is willing to really do that, and they can be trusted

2013-01-30 16:53:36	@evan	since that first step is entirely possible
2013-01-30 16:53:40	@evan	we shall go from there.
2013-01-30 16:53:46	wlll	evan: the trick is proving that, which I suspect you can't not to 100% certainty
2013-01-30 16:53:47	bradland	evan: you can never prove that
2013-01-30 16:53:51	raz	evan: err, i don't see how that is possible?
2013-01-30 16:53:56	mephux	raggi: i already offered my whole companys time.. with no reply.
2013-01-30 16:54:03	mephux	i even offered free software for life
2013-01-30 16:54:08	mephux	to monitor the software.
2013-01-30 16:54:10	@evan	I can prove it to a sufficient degree

2013-01-30 16:54:14	wlll	Like benchMark, you can get to a certain point of confidence
2013-01-30 16:54:15	@evan	especially based on everything else
2013-01-30 16:54:21	technomancy	we are starting to require signatures for the new Clojars repository
2013-01-30 16:54:21	bradland	evan, see point 1 in this document https://docs.google.com/document/d/10tuM51VKRcSHJtUZotraMlrMHWK1uXs8qQ6Hmguyf1g/edit#
2013-01-30 16:54:26	technomancy	but it's hard work and requires community buy-in
2013-01-30 16:54:30	bradland	i don't feel comfortable that we have acceptance on that
2013-01-30 16:54:33	mephux	evan: that's good ineed - keep up the good work man
2013-01-30 16:54:43	benchMark	I'm hugely in favor of getting some professional help from one of the pros in here who have offered their services.
2013-01-30 16:54:45	@evan	I'll restate what I said again: there is a lot we'll do after all this is over to go the extra mile
2013-01-30 16:54:46	@raggi	technomancy: what do you use for central trust? signing tree? central sig repo?
2013-01-30 16:54:51	raz	evan: sadly nothing can really be proved on a compromised box. it could be running a rootkit since 2009 ;)
2013-01-30 16:54:52	@evan	including rebuilding the infrastructure
2013-01-30 16:54:54	postmodern	i vote for re-installing the system, re-genning all the credentials, and maybe try out mephux's monitoring service, or at least give Snorby a try
2013-01-30 16:55:07	_eric	raz++
2013-01-30 16:55:11	@evan	that is the plan in the future
2013-01-30 16:55:16	@evan	but not today.
2013-01-30 16:55:19	bradland	+1 comfort level :)
2013-01-30 16:55:27	@evan	raz: we can hypthesis about all the crazy things
2013-01-30 16:55:28	_eric	evan: does the production environment have the ability to push to github?
2013-01-30 16:55:38	@evan	who knows, maybe someone from rackspace installed a hardware rootkit!
2013-01-30 16:55:44	technomancy	raggi: hoping to establish a web of trust, but we haven't really gotten that far yet. just need to start gathering signatures as a first step
2013-01-30 16:55:46	bradland	everyone please do what you can to document the scripts you're using to compare these hashes and what not
2013-01-30 16:55:46	@evan	again, not helpful to todays discussion.
2013-01-30 16:55:47	mephux	evan: yea, i'm feeling better about it.. and impressed evan pulled out some IR skills.. didn't see that coming. hehe
2013-01-30 16:55:49	benchMark	It's also not possible to confirm the box was even compromised beyond the exploit payload which was relatively benign. I'd love to know what percentage of folks burn down their whole infrastructure and rebuild it on evidence that slim. I bet it's a very small number.
2013-01-30 16:55:50	mephux	postmodern: yea, agree
2013-01-30 16:56:05	mephux	benchMark: A LOT
2013-01-30 16:56:09	@raggi	evan: raz: or maybe someone use a marshal exploit instead, and as we all pulled specs.4.8, we're all going through a proxy right now...
2013-01-30 16:56:10	@evan	mephux: this is not my first proverbial rodeo.
2013-01-30 16:56:20	mephux	look at the company Mandiant.com were i used to work.. thats there whole comapny

2013-01-30 16:56:32	raz	evan: well yes. realistically (as i said earlier) i'm also more interested in how the integrity can be better protected in the future (mandatory signing). looking forward to that discussion :)
2013-01-30 16:56:41	benchMark	mephux: In my experience, it's a very small number of companies that will completely roll over their infrastructure for an exploit of this nature.
2013-01-30 16:56:42	@evan	absolutely
2013-01-30 16:56:44	kernelsmith	seems to me, if the attacker cared little enuf to call the gem 'exploit' he/she isn't rootkitting, but then again maybe he/she was trying to make a point?
2013-01-30 16:56:45	samkottler	mephux: which means you live in the world of people who do that
2013-01-30 16:56:45	xorrbit	raz++
2013-01-30 16:56:48	@raggi	technomancy: yeah, we turned that stuff off because leaving the trust model to the community wasn't working
2013-01-30 16:56:50	xorrbit	manadatory signing or death!
2013-01-30 16:56:54	mephux	benchMark: what comapny would say they had to do that?
2013-01-30 16:56:55	mephux	;)

2013-01-30 17:25:36	@evan	Rubygems.org was hacked due to an YAML parsing vulnerability. At least one malicious gem was uploaded which potentially had access to sensitive data, including credentials necessary to tamper with gems.

2013-01-30 17:40:48	_eric	and messaging
2013-01-30 17:40:50	@evan	I want us to focus on the tangible things we can do right now.
2013-01-30 17:41:02	_eric	so, definitely continue to do the things that are tangible
2013-01-30 17:41:03	mephux	evan: everyone says that.. hehe ;) but keep up the good work - it's not fun to deal with.. flood insurance etc..
2013-01-30 17:41:06	@qrush	mephux: text is a bad communication medium when i'm stressed like this - i lack the knowledge and tools to help here, and all i'm seeing is repetition of facts we know
2013-01-30 17:41:18	_eric	but be careful about trying to crack down on messaging from other sources that you feel may paint you in a worse light than you would like
2013-01-30 17:41:41	mephux	qrush: correct, i'm just trying to make sure you guys don't say somethign thats not true.. it can make this bad thing.. EVEN worse.
2013-01-30 17:42:07	@qrush	i have no intention to lie about what's going on. i dont even know why i'm being accused of such.
2013-01-30 17:42:14	_eric	the lack of public messaging early on from status.rubygems.org outlining that this was the worst possible kind of exploit (it allowed someone to run any code they wanted to on the site)
2013-01-30 17:42:24	_eric	has caused problems for everyone
2013-01-30 17:42:32	nzkoz	qrush: despite mephux's … lacking tact… it's true that the only way you can make things worse is by prematurely declaring victory, so don't say anything until you 100% know what you're saying is correct
2013-01-30 17:42:32	@evan	let's be clear
2013-01-30 17:42:38	@evan	i'm not "cracking down" on heroku
2013-01-30 17:42:41	@evan	just asking them to clarify
2013-01-30 17:42:44	_eric	because once everyone knows what the worste case scenario is: "everything could be owned"
2013-01-30 17:42:50	_eric	once that is fully established
2013-01-30 17:42:56	@evan	so that I can make it easier for the public to understand the current state of things.
2013-01-30 17:42:57	@qrush	_eric: agreed...we need to have a better status site. i can't do anything about this right now beyond tweeting
2013-01-30 17:43:03	_eric	*then* it's useful to start doing the steps to try to explain what has been done to try to verify things
2013-01-30 17:43:31	@raggi	i'm getting a lot of mismatches between rubyforge and s3
2013-01-30 17:43:35	mephux	evan: correct, but they have costomers - and they care about their data. .if you make them look like fools.. bad things happen.
2013-01-30 17:43:35	lianj	refresh heroku page
2013-01-30 17:43:43	tmaher	sorry, yes, we just pushed the update
2013-01-30 17:43:53	mephux	it's best to assume you are in bad shape and worth twords proving you're not.
2013-01-30 17:44:34	mephux	anyway, not productive convo now.
2013-01-30 17:44:48	@raggi	can someone validate this example: Mismatch:  god-0.7.18.gem 271b8c946cbaddf5dfd9eb67f06cb5e7 75742e9bf83aca715424abd8be477cf0
2013-01-30 17:44:49	@qrush	i'm heading home - i need to get away from this and recharge. evan - ping me if you need me
2013-01-30 17:44:58	tmaher	Rest well, man!
2013-01-30 17:44:59	@raggi	qrush: thanks for everything! <3

2013-01-30 17:45:23	_eric	and as part of that, explaining the provenance of the data you used to verify is important

2013-01-30 17:46:07	jamesgolick	you're putting up a message that implies that everything looks good

2013-01-30 17:46:23	mephux	jamesgolick: i know.. i tried to talk to them about this.
2013-01-30 17:46:29	postmodern	jamesgolick, would require a kernel exploit
2013-01-30 17:46:40	@raggi	lianj: left side is from cloudfront, right side is from rubyforge
2013-01-30 17:46:44	mephux	jamesgolick: they have a plan.. gears are in motion and im sure we can talk them into geting a mem dump later
2013-01-30 17:46:49	@evan	I'm in the process of setting up new infrastructure for rubygems.org
2013-01-30 17:46:54	mephux	postmodern: not always
2013-01-30 17:47:00	tmaher	jamesgolick - additionally, I have yet to see criminal background checks on any of the principals involved in rubygems, nor have I seen anything approximating a pre-commit code review of code uploaded to rubygems.
2013-01-30 17:47:01	lianj	raggi: i got the left side
2013-01-30 17:47:09	mephux	postmodern: you assume they ntohing runnign the app had root
2013-01-30 17:47:19	mephux	that nothing*
2013-01-30 17:47:20	tmaher	rubygems is an arbitrary code distribution service.  There's a certain acceptance of risk that people take by using it.

2013-01-30 17:47:52	tmaher	assistance, even
2013-01-30 17:48:01	@raggi	lianj: yes, you would, point is, i'm getitng a lot of this -  it's probably outliers - people probably repacked gems when published to rubyforge vs published to gemcutter, but i would like to verify that somehow
2013-01-30 17:48:07	zzak	background check lol
2013-01-30 17:48:13	lianj	tmaher: right, that why i hope not to read 'all fixed, all gems safe, happily install anything someone points to you'
2013-01-30 17:48:24	@evan	tmaher: right now validating checksums is our most important thing
2013-01-30 17:48:33	tmaher	Honestly, if I were going to target rubygems, I'd go the social engineering route, not burn 0days
2013-01-30 17:48:44	mephux	postmodern: yea, which there has to be a few - i posted this in here before. http://kerneltrap.org/node/1584
2013-01-30 17:48:49	mephux	it's not hard to do.
2013-01-30 17:48:57	_eric	tmaher: YAML eval isn't even a 30-day at this point
2013-01-30 17:48:59	tmaher	evan - understood.  Please let us know if we can be of further help.  We're working on generating checksums now

2013-01-31 07:08:08	yasho99	yorickpeterse: I didn't mean key is in the gem - on the contrary - it is served by the web online service, like simple md5 and is outside of the gem
2013-01-31 07:08:51	yasho99	and also md5 could/should be on different online service than the rubygems
2013-01-31 07:09:50	yorickpeterse	You'd have to unpack the Gem to get the URL
2013-01-31 07:10:09	yorickpeterse	So the best way would be to do something like `GET /api/gems/foobar/signatures` to retrieve the signature for each version
2013-01-31 07:10:22	yorickpeterse	and then `GET /api/gems/foobar/public-keys` for the keys
2013-01-31 07:11:19	yasho99	I meant the link to the key to be part of the rubygems home of the particular gem and part of the process of publishing gem to the rubygems not part of the gemspec

2013-01-31 08:39:11	yorickpeterse	Well, the system is divided into two parts: 1. the keyservers 2. the clients
2013-01-31 08:39:34	yorickpeterse	A client creates a public/private key, keeps the private key and pushes the public key to a certain server
2013-01-31 08:39:49	yorickpeterse	Depending on what servers mirror it this key will be distributed across thet net

2013-01-31 08:40:49	yorickpeterse	When installing a Gem Rubygems (the `gem` command probably) will check if there are any signatures available for the the Gem, this is done by executing an extra HTTP request *or* by sending a list of keys along with the initial response.
2013-01-31 08:41:03	yorickpeterse	However, the keys *should* be separate and not distributed in the Gem itself

2013-01-31 08:42:14	yorickpeterse	What many package managers do is that they have a central package/repo containing commonly used keys (e.g. from core developers) and install those on your system
2013-01-31 08:42:37	yorickpeterse	For example, on Arch Linux there's a package named "archlinux-keyring" (if I'm not mistaken) which contains all the public keys of trusted developers

2013-01-31 08:43:47	yorickpeterse	This is also where the problem lies: if you're lazy and just choose "I fully trust this key" and it's fake you're fucked

2013-01-31 10:24:55	derekprior	it could be scripted from the users point of view. They run a script pointing at their known-good gem. The script gets the sha512 of the script and the key and provides that to user to use as verification.
2013-01-31 10:25:00	yorickpeterse	I'm also not sure how secure API keys are: the hack would allow arbitrary code execution, it could be that the hacker stole the API keys (unless they are hashed)

2013-01-31 13:05:52	stevenhaddox	Wow. I missed over half this conversation. I thought @qrush made it clear that the situation was to validate gems as quickly as possible, migrate rubygems to AWS and table the discussion of signing, stronger security momentarily until prior status quo is essentially restored? I don't see how that's ignoring it, it's prioritizing the backlog like we all do every day...
2013-01-31 13:05:53	mephux	and made the issue worse for everyone.

2013-01-31 13:35:48	yorickpeterse	Oh
2013-01-31 13:36:03	yorickpeterse	Well, qrush, me, postmodern and a few others had talks about it
2013-01-31 13:36:05	@drbrain	yorickpeterse: it's baked in to `gem`
2013-01-31 13:36:10	technomancy	it's helpful to start gathering signatures as early as possible even if you don't have the infrastructure yet to verify them
2013-01-31 13:36:19	@drbrain	technomancy: yes
2013-01-31 13:36:20	yorickpeterse	But qrush wants to wait with talking about it until this security stuff is over
2013-01-31 13:36:29	yorickpeterse	drbrain: that uses SSL certificates
2013-01-31 13:36:34	sferik	if 50% of gems were signed, would that have made an exploit like this any easier to verify?
2013-01-31 13:36:39	yorickpeterse	unless you mean the PGP plugin
2013-01-31 13:36:43	@drbrain	sferik: vastly
2013-01-31 13:36:55	sferik	okay, I guess I'll start signing my gems then
2013-01-31 13:36:57	yorickpeterse	also my internet here in the train is slow as balls so expect slow replies :)

2013-01-31 16:32:48	boonedocks	stevenhaddox: looks like a good writeup. As part of a deploy process, do you need to commit the local gems to your app repository? Or is there some setting that will send them up from local when you deploy?
2013-01-31 16:34:54	stevenhaddox	boonedocks: We commit them to ours. We also have some projects that are unable to access rubygems.org anyway though so it's just part of habit for us.
2013-01-31 16:35:29	stevenhaddox	boonedocks: Bundler actually has a capistrano plugin that handles doing all the install steps for you if you just call the hook ;)
2013-01-31 16:35:37	stevenhaddox	I'll see if I can find that and add it to the write-up

2013-01-31 17:07:32	indirect	sure, give me a minute
2013-01-31 17:07:38	stevenhaddox	indirect: so --deployment doesn't require bundle package? Will it use --local first or does --deployment try to hit rubygems.org period

2013-01-31 17:07:52	stevenhaddox	at least the deployment page, which discusses capistrano

2013-01-31 17:08:58	stevenhaddox	can't recall if we used `bundle install --local` custom in Capistrano or if we just used the default hook (or the prior before the default plugin existed)

2013-01-31 17:11:02	stevenhaddox	so if `bundle install --deployment` ends up pinging rubygems.org I'll yank that part out and tell them they need to manually invoke `bundle install --local` after packaging in their deploy scripts for now and to go back to --deployment once this all blows over if possible.

2013-01-31 17:12:04	stevenhaddox	That's what I had at first (reference my original version). I thought we used --deployment default w/ Capistrano though and I know we couldn't hit rg.org then so I was hoping it might not query it if it's already packaged.

Makes it easy to see what is abusing resources at certain points...not necessarily just at the moment (like top or the regular Task Manager does). Are there any utilities like this for linux? one that I can run and check back on in an hour and see what processes were most impactful over that time? tia

2013-02-03 13:46:14	indirect	sferik: ?
2013-02-03 13:46:19	indirect	why is that
2013-02-03 13:46:21	sferik	indirect: https://travis-ci.org/sferik/twitter/jobs/4547520
2013-02-03 13:46:28	sferik	fails with the error: Errno::ENOENT: No such file or directory - /Users/sferik/.gem/private_key.pem
2013-02-03 13:46:49	sferik	(obviously, it passes on my box, but I can repro by mving my private_key.pem file)
2013-02-03 13:46:53	indirect	sferik: and does `gem install` work?
2013-02-03 13:47:17	sferik	it works on 1.9 with bundler 1.2.3
2013-02-03 13:47:17	indirect	like, do you understand the reason that this is happening? :)
2013-02-03 13:47:32	indirect	huh
2013-02-03 13:47:45	sferik	indirect: I'm not entirely sure it's a bundler issue
2013-02-03 13:47:47	indirect	I am not aware of anything that changed that would effect that
2013-02-03 13:47:59	indirect	I believe that the problem is that you're trying to use a development gemspec
2013-02-03 13:48:08	sferik	indirect: maybe be rubygems 2.0 cc/ drbrain 
2013-02-03 13:48:17	-->	tmilewski (~tmilewski@108.35.4.28) has joined #rubygems
2013-02-03 13:48:21	indirect	and signing introduces a new and exciting problem with development gemspecs that has never existed before
2013-02-03 13:48:32	indirect	namely, the gemspec being buildable now depends on your private key file existing
2013-02-03 13:49:01	sferik	indirect: seems to work fine on Ruby 1.9 with bundler 1.2.3 and rubygems 1.8.25
2013-02-03 13:49:13	indirect	then I don't know what's going on :)
2013-02-03 13:49:20	indirect	maybe you can try swapping those out one at a time
2013-02-03 13:49:27	indirect	to finger either bundler or rubygems 2 or ruby 2
2013-02-03 13:49:45	sferik	drbrain: have you seen this before?
2013-02-03 13:50:05	@raggi	oh, it'll fail wiht git gems if you do that, probably
2013-02-03 13:50:28	sferik	raggi: yes, see: https://github.com/sferik/rails_admin/issues/1503
2013-02-03 13:50:30	@raggi	the whole thing of keeping the key paths in predefined gemspecs is busted, for bundler style use cases
2013-02-03 13:50:33	indirect	raggi: yes, it seems like the issue here is that the current signing mechanism is fatal to path/git gems
2013-02-03 13:50:52	@raggi	indirect: evne though the paths are common
2013-02-03 13:50:59	@raggi	you probably don't want that information exposure anyway
2013-02-03 13:51:04	indirect	yes
2013-02-03 13:51:07	sferik	I don't understand why it can't just ignore that path

2013-02-03 13:51:13	sferik	seems like it only matters when the gem is being built
2013-02-03 13:51:19	indirect	heh
2013-02-03 13:51:36	sferik	I agree, it's busted to hardcode /Users/sferik/.gem/private_key.pem into my gems
2013-02-03 13:51:44	sferik	it only works for gems who are pushed by a single person
2013-02-03 13:52:00	sferik	which is not true for many gems, especially the most popular ones
2013-02-03 13:52:29	sferik	basically, once I add that line, only I can gem push, even if other people have access on RubyGems.org
2013-02-03 13:52:45	@raggi	sferik: so, her's a solution for you
2013-02-03 13:52:49	@raggi	i do this with spec.files too
2013-02-03 13:53:02	@raggi	wrap it in: if $0 =~ /gem/
2013-02-03 13:54:10	sferik	raggi: that still doesn't solve the problem of multiple people signing
2013-02-03 13:54:24	@raggi	sferik: huh?
2013-02-03 13:54:30	@raggi	that shoudl be orthogonal to this bug
2013-02-03 13:54:33	sferik	it is
2013-02-03 13:54:37	sferik	you're right
2013-02-03 13:54:52	@raggi	i just need to check spec.to_ruby
2013-02-03 13:55:06	-->	onemanjujitsu (~sebastian@98.204.157.98) has joined #rubygems
2013-02-03 13:55:18	indirect	raggi: so bundler just started using spec.to_ruby inside git gems
2013-02-03 13:55:21	@raggi	gah, we spit out signing key on spec.to_ruby
2013-02-03 13:55:26	indirect	not even released in a pre yet
2013-02-03 13:55:31	indirect	but that seems…. bad
2013-02-03 13:55:35	@raggi	well
2013-02-03 13:55:41	@raggi	it's supposed to round trip right now, i guess
2013-02-03 13:55:50	indirect	that means bundle package --all is going to be checking in the signing key :'(
2013-02-03 13:56:06	@raggi	indirect: oh, it shouldn't not unless you pull it by hand
2013-02-03 13:56:12	@raggi	that's just a path
2013-02-03 13:56:17	indirect	oh, just the path?
2013-02-03 13:56:17	indirect	okay
2013-02-03 13:56:20	indirect	seems better
2013-02-03 13:58:19	@raggi	indirect: so, when you use git gems
2013-02-03 13:58:23	@raggi	do you run gem build?
2013-02-03 13:58:43	indirect	raggi: no
2013-02-03 13:58:48	Antiarc	sferik: You can use File.expand_path("~/.gem/private_key.pem")
2013-02-03 13:59:04	Antiarc	That way so long as your whole team has a privkey relative to their home directory it works fine.
2013-02-03 13:59:13	sferik	right
2013-02-03 13:59:26	sferik	that seems better
2013-02-03 13:59:51	sferik	okay, thanks for the suggestion
2013-02-03 14:00:45	@raggi	er
2013-02-03 14:00:48	@raggi	that won't work
2013-02-03 14:00:56	@raggi	i mean, it will in the git case
2013-02-03 14:01:11	@raggi	but in other cases, if it passes through spec.to_ruby, it'll be expanded again
2013-02-03 14:01:40	@raggi	sferik: you probably don't want ot commit the gemspec with this line in it
2013-02-03 14:01:53	sferik	no?
2013-02-03 14:01:57	@raggi	sferik: or wrap an ENV var around it or the like, to avoid it being set at inappropriate times
2013-02-03 14:02:13	Antiarc	Sorry, I'm missing something; where will that break?
2013-02-03 14:02:18	@raggi	ENV['signing'] = true
2013-02-03 14:02:24	@raggi	or w/e
2013-02-03 14:02:25	sferik	other gem commands?
2013-02-03 14:02:30	sferik	other than build?
2013-02-03 14:02:48	Antiarc	Do other gem commands even consider the signing key?
2013-02-03 14:04:18	@raggi	sferik: do you have a backtrace for the issue
2013-02-03 14:04:30	@raggi	sferik: or a replication repo
2013-02-03 14:04:37	@raggi	sferik: i'm just wondering exactly what's causing the load attempt
2013-02-03 14:04:41	sferik	it just raises an Errno::ENOENT: No such file or directory - /Users/sferik/.gem/private_key.pem
2013-02-03 14:04:51	@raggi	i imagine there will be multiple paths to this issue being caused
2013-02-03 14:04:56	sferik	it's easy to repro
2013-02-03 14:04:58	@raggi	but we can probably nail the frequent ones easily
2013-02-03 14:05:21	sferik	but i'm curious why it only happens on Ruby 2.0 / Rubygems 2.0 / Bundler 1.3
2013-02-03 14:05:50	@raggi	gah, soab

2013-02-03 17:37:37	teancom	Hrrm. Just ran a test install, no ssl error for me.
2013-02-03 17:37:48	injekt	yeah works on a vps for me too
2013-02-03 17:37:51	injekt	it's just locally
2013-02-03 17:38:01	injekt	it worked this morning however
2013-02-03 17:38:06	teancom	If you run 'host rubygems.org', what do you get back?
2013-02-03 17:38:43	injekt	rubygems.org has address 54.245.255.174
2013-02-03 17:39:20	teancom	Well, that's correct.
2013-02-03 17:39:27	injekt	Yup
2013-02-03 17:39:31	teancom	Is the time of your local computer way off?

2013-02-03 17:40:47	injekt	same thing when I try and change the source
2013-02-03 17:42:19	teancom	Yeah, I don't know why it's trying to hit gemcutter.org, but that is the old name. 
2013-02-03 17:42:38	injekt	hah
2013-02-03 17:42:40	injekt	I got it
2013-02-03 17:43:11	teancom	Reconfigured to hit rubygems.org instead?
2013-02-03 17:43:45	injekt	yeah, it's reading from a .gemrc, even though I specified --source it looks like it didn't take
2013-02-03 17:43:52	injekt	removed the .gemrc and it works
