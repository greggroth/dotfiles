2013-01-15 12:29:24	@EC	Is step hiding operational right now in RetailMe Mac?
2013-01-15 14:25:04	eblair	EC: Yeah, it should be (sorry for the delay - I forget to check IRC sometimes)
2013-01-15 14:25:16	eblair	Anything in particular you're looking at
2013-01-15 14:25:17	eblair	?
2013-01-15 15:31:57	jonathanwallace	EC: did you load production mongo into intersect-train mongo on friday when you did the database?
2013-01-15 15:49:41	@EC	jonathanwallace: Yes
2013-01-15 15:49:57	@EC	eblair: Yes. Let me run through my scenario again so I can articulate it.
2013-01-15 15:50:55	@EC	eblair: Here’s what’s happening:
2013-01-15 15:51:02	@EC	Create a new lesson…
2013-01-15 15:51:14	@EC	open the step outline
2013-01-15 15:51:18	@EC	create a new step
2013-01-15 15:51:31	@EC	add a country of publication to the launch countries
2013-01-15 15:51:46	@EC	open the locale view menu and switch to a locale in the country you just added
2013-01-15 15:51:57	@EC	right-click on the step you created and select “Hide”
2013-01-15 15:52:03	@EC	The step is not hidden
2013-01-15 15:52:17	@EC	Is that expected behavior, bug or incomplete feature?
2013-01-15 15:52:18	eblair	Huh. That's not supposed to happen
2013-01-15 15:52:26	eblair	Or at least, it seems like it's not supposed to happen
2013-01-15 15:52:27	@EC	Got it.
2013-01-15 15:52:28	@EC	k
2013-01-15 15:52:37	@EC	I’ll capture it in a screen recording and file a bug.
2013-01-15 15:54:24	jonathanwallace	EC: i believe i know why that's happening
2013-01-15 15:55:04	jonathanwallace	i'm thinking it has to do with the locale fallbacks
2013-01-15 15:55:42	@EC	jonathanwallace: Good news. Spent the morning looking into your fallbacks question from December.
2013-01-15 15:55:45	@EC	Have the answer now.
2013-01-15 15:55:51	@EC	Will send out after the meeting.
2013-01-15 15:56:25	eblair	jonathanwallace: Are you talking about the step hiding or something else (there are times I wish we had threaded discussions)
2013-01-15 15:58:14	jonathanwallace	i was talking about step hiding.  i implemented the ordered_step method that returns the steps for a lesson.  we fallback through locales and the first locale that has any steps, we then return all non-hidden steps for that locale
2013-01-15 15:58:58	jonathanwallace	so imagine that you have a step created.  you hide it in the first locale, but its still available in the fallback locale.  then you would still see the step
2013-01-15 15:59:41	jonathanwallace	i'm not certain that's the case in what EC described above but it sounds possible
2013-01-15 16:00:21	jonathanwallace	and IIRC, this is also related to my fallbacks question that EC referenced.
2013-01-15 16:01:00	eblair	Shouldn't be the case EC described - that workflow is all before we send anything to the server

2013-01-15 16:02:52	jonathanwallace	ah, k
2013-01-15 16:03:14	jonathanwallace	i didn't want anyone to go on a wild goose case for something that is known
2013-01-15 16:06:14	jonathanwallace	eblair: so based on EC reloading mongo (the Creator side of things), you should see a bunch of old style creator::lessons and such already
2013-01-15 16:07:37	eblair	jonathanwallace: We're just getting the 4 lessons that Brian and I have created
2013-01-15 16:14:49	jonathanwallace	maybe EC can speak to that?  i'm only seeing 4 too
2013-01-15 16:15:30	jonathanwallace	maybe there were none there when it was loaded into intersect-train?
2013-01-15 16:16:03	jonathanwallace	it being the production mongo dump
2013-01-15 16:19:23	@EC	eblair: Screen capture of that issue at: https://greenhopper.apple.com/browse/RMETR-366
2013-01-15 16:19:55	eblair	Thanks. I repro'd it while we were chatting. I'll probably bang on it after the meeting
2013-01-15 16:20:35	@EC	jonathanwallace: So what’s up with the Mongo data?
2013-01-15 16:22:00	jonathanwallace	EC: as i understand it, eric and brian harmann need legacy data that has been migrated to the new format to check things out.
2013-01-15 16:22:24	@EC	k
2013-01-15 16:22:41	@EC	What does it take to migrate the old training content?
2013-01-15 16:22:45	jonathanwallace	my expectation is that i could run the migration code over some legacy data that you had loaded on friday
2013-01-15 16:22:52	@EC	Sounds right
2013-01-15 16:23:57	jonathanwallace	we have a rake task for migrating a single course (and another for a single lesson) given its Training id.
2013-01-15 16:24:33	jonathanwallace	i would expect that there would be more than the four documents that Brian and Eric have created in the Creator::Lesson collection
2013-01-15 16:24:59	jonathanwallace	but it could be that i'm just misunderstanding how long the mongo document lives?
2013-01-15 16:25:30	@EC	Well, remember in production today there is no separation of staging and published content for training.
2013-01-15 16:25:38	@EC	There’s only Training:: content
2013-01-15 16:26:05	@EC	So the 4 Creator:: objects you guys are seeing in RetailMe Mac are documents that have been created with the training build of RetailMe Mac.
2013-01-15 16:26:35	@EC	To make all the legacy data appear you’ll have to run the upgrade process against the legacy data.
2013-01-15 16:26:50	@EC	Which I would have thought Andy might have done using a batching Rake task.
2013-01-15 16:27:12	@EC	But maybe you’ll have to iterate through all Training::Lessons/Courses and run the Rake task individually?
2013-01-15 16:27:41	@EC	On Friday we ran the database migrations but have not done any legacy data upgrades
2013-01-15 16:27:41	jonathanwallace	no, he also created the rake task to batch through them all
2013-01-15 16:27:48	jonathanwallace	https://code.apple.com/gist/fe871168867239aa8a02
2013-01-15 16:27:49	@EC	Oh, great
2013-01-15 16:27:54	@EC	So probably just run that?
2013-01-15 16:28:14	@EC	Or am I misunderstanding the problem?
2013-01-15 16:28:32	jonathanwallace	nope, you're helping me understand what's meant by 'legacy data'
2013-01-15 16:28:42	@EC	lol I hope, anyway
2013-01-15 16:28:48	@EC	That’s what I think of as legacy data
2013-01-15 16:28:54	@EC	“What’s in production today”
2013-01-15 16:29:02	jonathanwallace	so in this case, a Training::Lesson with id X that now lives in intersect-train is considered legacy data
2013-01-15 16:29:07	jonathanwallace	gotcha
2013-01-15 16:29:15	@EC	Yes
2013-01-15 16:29:31	@EC	Once you run that script once, though, it will be the upgraded content until we reload the database again
2013-01-15 16:29:55	@EC	eblair: Is that also your definition of legacy data?
2013-01-15 16:29:58	jonathanwallace	right, i only wanted to run it for one or two courses/lessons for brian and eric since the batch rake task will take hours
2013-01-15 16:30:04	@EC	eblair: Are we on the right track for what you need here?
2013-01-15 16:30:14	@EC	jonathanwallace: Ahhh…got it
2013-01-15 16:30:28	@EC	I’m out—meeting time!
2013-01-15 16:30:35	jonathanwallace	and i was asking brian and eric for a lesson or course i should try it against
2013-01-15 16:30:44	eblair	Sounds like it
2013-01-15 16:31:12	eblair	(and Brian and I have almost no idea about the content of the legacy data, so we're not sure what we should be asking for :))
2013-01-15 16:31:33	jonathanwallace	haha, yup.
2013-01-15 16:31:38	jonathanwallace	i'll just guess then
2013-01-15 16:32:12	eblair	If you can tell something got a few steps that aren't quizzes or rewards or validations and are localized, that'd be great
2013-01-15 16:32:46	eblair	Basically, something that'll spit out a few of the intermediate HTML-formatted steps in a few locales.
2013-01-15 16:33:04	jonathanwallace	k, i'll be able to get that done today (maybe during the call ;))
2013-01-15 17:23:42	eblair	EC: Should the step hiding bug be added to this Release?

2013-01-31 11:40:43	greggroth	I just want to make sure that we want to allow a content creator to remove a lesson from a course once both have been published.
2013-01-31 11:43:05	greggroth	From the bug report, it sounds like removing a lesson from a published course somehow unpublishes the lesson.  If that is the case, then it isn't unpublishing through the usualy channels or else the course should also be unpublished.
2013-01-31 11:45:06	@EC	I’m not certain of the desired behavior there.

2013-04-25 16:03:29	@EC	Sometimes atomic updates really suck.
2013-04-25 16:10:37	jonathanwallace	really?
2013-04-25 16:13:19	@EC	Well…I guess you could argue it as a bug
2013-04-25 16:13:52	@EC	But it seems like the response would be “behaves as expected”
2013-04-25 16:13:56	@EC	I’ll explore

2013-04-26 13:16:58	@EC	Okay
2013-04-26 13:17:01	@EC	Integrated yet?
2013-04-26 13:17:10	greggroth	nope about to create the pull request
2013-04-26 13:17:39	greggroth	The failures I were working on were miscategorized and had the same cause as the failures listed on that card.
2013-04-26 13:17:47	greggroth	So I copied them over and am about to make the pull request.
2013-04-26 13:18:04	greggroth	I just wanted to make sure you wern't working on that card at the moment

2013-04-26 13:54:53	greggroth	I believe that conflict arrises because it adds a translation conflict and sets `conflict = nil` in the same operaiton
2013-04-26 13:55:02	greggroth	working on a solution.
2013-04-26 14:08:53	@EC	Yep
2013-04-26 14:08:56	@EC	That’s what I was seeing
2013-04-26 14:09:23	@EC	Although experiments in a test app suggest that should be okay
2013-04-26 14:09:51	@EC	(The code we’ve got)
2013-04-26 14:10:00	@EC	Expected behavior is Mongoid will send those as two distinct statements
2013-04-26 14:10:33	@EC	There are a couple of old Mongoid issues describing the behavior
2013-04-26 14:12:32	@EC	If you’ve got that I’m going to move on to the next failure

2013-04-26 14:38:46	jonathanwallace	which ones?
2013-04-26 14:39:05	@EC	Firing database statements on assignment 
2013-04-26 14:39:21	@EC	For example, translation.conflict = nil
2013-04-26 14:39:30	@EC	That immediately fires an update statement to Mongo
2013-04-26 14:39:52	@EC	If, immediately following, you ask if the document has changed: translation.changed?
2013-04-26 14:39:56	@EC	The answer is “no”
2013-04-26 14:40:03	@EC	Because the change was instantly persisted
2013-04-26 14:41:19	@EC	Take that further. If the document hasn’t changed Mongoid decides it doesn’t need to fire before_save callbacks because nothing has changed.
2013-04-26 14:41:22	@EC	(WTF?)
2013-04-26 14:41:50	@EC	In general, the last week has left me feeling like Mongoid tries to be too smart for its own good
2013-04-26 14:44:21	@EC	Some of that seems to follow from a desire to match ActiveRecord’s behavior which is well-intended but a little misguided, I think, since Mongo is not a relational database.
2013-04-26 14:44:22	jonathanwallace	WTF in deed!
2013-04-26 14:44:49	@EC	What I do appreciate is how open durran is to change and his desire to get it just right
2013-04-26 14:45:21	@EC	It looks like it will just be a somewhat painful journey.
2013-04-26 14:51:36	jonathanwallace	yeah, i've read some stuff where he's working on removing the abstractions that don't make sense for an ODM
2013-04-26 14:54:01	greggroth	EC  sorry I was AFK for our tech talk.  I haven't found a way around hitting the database yet.
2013-04-26 14:56:07	@EC	Can either of you confirm that features/creator/message_publication.feature is passing on the latest head of training_with_mongoid?
2013-04-26 14:56:22	@EC	It’s the third batch of failures I’ve pulled that’s passing
2013-04-26 14:56:28	@EC	Getting nervous something’s wrong on my end
2013-04-26 15:01:10	@EC	Or greggroth’s GoLive change fixed everything
2013-04-26 15:02:54	@EC	Ahhh…there’s a failure!

2013-04-26 16:07:51	greggroth	I guess because it's trying to `$unset` on the first translation and `$pushAll` to update the translations.
2013-04-26 16:08:51	greggroth	the translations array it's trying to insert looks right.
2013-04-26 16:12:35	@EC	Ah
2013-04-26 16:12:45	@EC	Yes, we should figure out why it’s doing that, though
2013-04-26 16:13:06	@EC	I tried recreating the operation in a test app and it performed the unset and the set as separate operations
2013-04-26 16:13:17	@EC	Which I learned through old Mongoid issues is the expected behavior
2013-04-26 16:13:29	@EC	So either we’ve found a bug or we may doing something wrong
2013-04-26 16:15:53	@EC	Want some help isolating that?
2013-04-26 16:16:27	@EC	I’ve just found another design conundrum that I’m not sure how to get out of 
2013-04-26 16:17:26	@EC	Eww except with callbacks
2013-04-26 16:17:44	greggroth	heh  boo callbacks
2013-04-26 16:20:16	@EC	Let me run this by you and see if you’ve got any ideas
2013-04-26 16:20:24	@EC	Duplicating an Issue
2013-04-26 16:20:48	@EC	While duplicating the translations on a document (say, an Article)
2013-04-26 16:21:02	@EC	Translation#data= is called
2013-04-26 16:21:18	@EC	To assign the attributes from the source translation to the duplicate translation
2013-04-26 16:21:34	@EC	But we’ve designed it so any change to the translation data triggers versioning
2013-04-26 16:21:41	greggroth	right
2013-04-26 16:21:46	@EC	Which is not appropriate during duplication
2013-04-26 16:22:07	@EC	I’m currently thinking the correct behavior is to only perform versioning when a document is persisted
2013-04-26 16:22:33	@EC	Since we’re really trying to track finished representations
2013-04-26 16:22:43	@EC	And not changes between persistences
2013-04-26 16:28:22	@EC	See any problems with that?
2013-04-26 16:28:48	greggroth	hm.
2013-04-26 16:29:23	greggroth	so the version of the translation on the duplicated issue is 2.1 while the orginal issue's translation is 1.1?
2013-04-26 16:29:48	@EC	1.0 original, 1.1 duplicated
2013-04-26 16:29:52	@EC	With no change to the content
2013-04-26 16:30:57	@EC	While the change in the version number indicates the content has been changed in the local representation of the document, indicating it is materially different than the global representation
2013-04-26 16:31:00	greggroth	Ah.  So that it bumps the minor version every time it persists
2013-04-26 16:31:05	@EC	Yep
2013-04-26 16:31:16	@EC	Because we tell it to do so on any assignment (data=)
2013-04-26 16:31:18	greggroth	it's always seemed odd to me.
2013-04-26 16:31:35	@EC	Which part?
2013-04-26 16:32:46	greggroth	I feel like I've never seen a 1.0 document.
2013-04-26 16:32:51	greggroth	they're always 1.1
2013-04-26 16:32:54	greggroth	or 2.1, etc
2013-04-26 16:33:18	jonathanwallace	EC: that seems reasonable to only care about versioning on persistance instead of assignment
2013-04-26 16:33:21	greggroth	I haven't taken the time to fully understand the versioning system, but just that
2013-04-26 16:33:53	greggroth	if it's used only for conflict resoultion, then it doesn't matter if anything actually changed
2013-04-26 16:35:06	@EC	You should be able to see a 1.0 document by launching RetailMe Mac, creating a new <article|task|message|etc.> and saving it.
2013-04-26 16:35:31	@EC	Changes to the global representation increase the major number
2013-04-26 16:35:42	@EC	Changes made to a local representation (through Mac) increase the minor number
2013-04-26 16:36:46	@EC	When a new translation from iWorld is attached a conflict is created if the current translation’s minor number is greater than 0
2013-04-26 16:37:05	greggroth	re: conflict.  It appears that when the conflict is asssigned (`conflict = `) it immediately persists.  However, when setting `conflict = nil`, it does not.  
2013-04-26 16:37:11	@EC	Because the content creator may have decided to take matters into their own hands
2013-04-26 16:38:05	@EC	greggroth: Can you rephrase that? I don’t quite understand.
2013-04-26 16:38:29	jonathanwallace	when a value not nil is passed to content= , persistence occurs?
2013-04-26 16:38:45	greggroth	other way around.
2013-04-26 16:38:53	@EC	Only when nil is assigned?
2013-04-26 16:39:21	greggroth	from the docs:  "Set the embedded document. If the parent document is persisted, then the child will be atomically saved immediately. If setting to nil then the child will be deleted."
2013-04-26 16:39:38	@EC	Oh
2013-04-26 16:39:42	@EC	So any value
2013-04-26 16:39:44	greggroth	the docs aren't clear, but it appears that setting `nil` doesn't immediately trigger persistence
2013-04-26 16:39:49	@EC	But determined by the state of the parent
2013-04-26 16:40:00	greggroth	right
2013-04-26 16:40:10	@EC	Fun
2013-04-26 16:40:35	jonathanwallace	wow
2013-04-26 16:40:36	jonathanwallace	nice
2013-04-26 16:41:16	@EC	Still, it appears the expectation is that the $unset (= nil) should happen as a query independent of the $set query
2013-04-26 16:41:32	@EC	But we’re seeing those combined into one statement, right?
2013-04-26 16:43:59	@EC	Changing locations
2013-04-26 16:44:00	greggroth	What I understand to be happening is that when we build the new translation, we're modifying the `translations` field on the parent document.  When we set `conflict = nil` for a translation, it tries to $unset at grid_items.0.translations.0.conflict
2013-04-26 16:44:02	@EC	Back when I can
2013-04-26 16:44:05	greggroth	thus accessing the translations array
2013-04-26 16:44:48	greggroth	tl;dr the new translation is going to be persisted anyways, but when we build rather than create it it's put off until we set `conflict=nil` which conflicts
2013-04-26 16:45:15	greggroth	also changing locations.  be back on in 15.
2013-04-26 16:45:40	greggroth	but it looks like it wont make much of a difference to create rather than build the new translation.

2013-04-29 14:56:44	@EC	Depends on the document
2013-04-29 14:57:03	@EC	There are probably many ways 
2013-04-29 14:57:23	@EC	One is to create the document in RetailMe Mac, add a go live, save it, change your mind and remove the go live
2013-04-29 14:58:55	@EC	You’d have to reproduce it and observe but I believe in that situation RetailMe Mac would send an empty #go_lives_attributes back on the second save

2013-04-30 11:33:49	@EC	*minutes
2013-04-30 11:50:47	greggroth	EC:  Sorry I just saw the message.  What's up?
2013-04-30 11:51:50	@EC	I’m stuck.
2013-04-30 11:52:02	@EC	Could use some alternative ideas.
2013-04-30 11:52:17	@EC	Working on resolving some failures related to Creator::Issue duplication.
2013-04-30 11:52:35	@EC	The gist is, when duplicating an issue we clone each of its spreads (articles).
2013-04-30 11:52:52	@EC	Mongoid uses custom cloning.
2013-04-30 11:53:13	@EC	Which basically walks the entire document hierarchy (root and all embedded documents) and assembles a big attributes hash.
2013-04-30 11:53:25	@EC	Then it instantiates a new instance of the root class…
2013-04-30 11:53:43	@EC	…and passes in that hash attribute to set all of the attributes and create all of the embedded objects.
2013-04-30 11:54:11	@EC	We encounter problems with this methodology in Creator::Translation#data=
2013-04-30 11:54:26	@EC	Because we’ve tied versioning in with #data assignment
2013-04-30 11:54:48	@EC	“Cloning” an article increases the version number of any Translations embedded within it.
2013-04-30 11:54:51	greggroth	so it sets data without using the `data=` method?
2013-04-30 11:55:04	greggroth	oh so we don't want it to use the `data=` method.
2013-04-30 11:55:07	@EC	No, actually the problem is that it uses data=
2013-04-30 11:55:10	@EC	Yep
2013-04-30 11:55:15	@EC	Well, that’s one option
2013-04-30 11:55:42	@EC	So the question is, how can we clone an article without increasing the version numbers of embedded translations?
2013-04-30 11:58:24	greggroth	that's a tough one.
2013-04-30 11:58:29	greggroth	let me think for a second.
2013-04-30 11:58:33	@EC	Sure
2013-04-30 12:02:05	greggroth	Is there a test you're using for this?
2013-04-30 12:02:19	@EC	features/creator/issue_duplication.rb
2013-04-30 12:03:52	@EC	I’m starting to get into some wild ideas
2013-04-30 12:04:06	@EC	Which seems unnecessary 
2013-04-30 12:04:11	greggroth	I wonder if checking whether it's been persisted will work
2013-04-30 12:04:15	greggroth	in #bump?
2013-04-30 12:04:18	greggroth	*trying*
2013-04-30 12:04:24	@EC	Thought about that
2013-04-30 12:05:10	greggroth	no dice?
2013-04-30 12:05:15	@EC	Works great until you realize that API clients send brand-new translations through the API which represent content-creator-written translations that need to be represented by a .1 version number
2013-04-30 12:05:25	@EC	And since versioning is entirely internal to the server
2013-04-30 12:05:40	@EC	If the bump was skipped on a new record it would start at 1.0
2013-04-30 12:06:24	@EC	Crash course on versioning:
2013-04-30 12:06:58	@EC	x.0 signifies a translation of the global representation of a document (en-ZZ)
2013-04-30 12:07:22	@EC	And the way our applications are designed, indicates the translation was processed through iWorld/WorldServer
2013-04-30 12:07:55	@EC	An x.1+ version number indicates a modification to a local representation of a document
2013-04-30 12:08:15	@EC	And the way our applications are designed, indicates the translation was created/modified by the content creator
2013-04-30 12:08:49	@EC	When an x.0 is returning from WorldServer/iWorld a conflict is created if an x.1 exists on the document at the time of attachment
2013-04-30 12:09:10	@EC	Because the content creator may have decided to forgo the WorldServer translation and write their own
2013-04-30 12:11:52	greggroth	What triggers a bump to the major version number?
2013-04-30 12:13:17	@EC	A simple example: the global representation is prepared and submitted for translation. The submitted translations are stamped as version 1.0. Then the content creator makes additional changes. The act of changing the document after a representation has gone to translation increases the version number to 2.0.
2013-04-30 12:16:39	@EC	I’ve used up way more than the 10 minutes I asked for
2013-04-30 12:17:01	@EC	Here are the options I’m done to:
2013-04-30 12:17:33	@EC	- Provide a Translation.without_versioning block that disables versioning during execution. Not a frontrunner.
2013-04-30 12:17:56	@EC	- Override Mongoid’s #clone on each document
2013-04-30 12:18:31	@EC	Well, that’s really it
2013-04-30 12:18:39	@EC	The rest are details of how to do those
2013-04-30 12:19:09	greggroth	I'm already a bit uncomfortable with how much monkey patching we've had to do as it is.  I'm leaning towads the first option.  
2013-04-30 12:19:18	greggroth	Have you played around with it yet?
2013-04-30 12:19:42	@EC	Right now I’m thinking a DocumentCloner that implements a custom cloning procedure is the way to go
2013-04-30 12:19:50	greggroth	I like that
2013-04-30 12:19:51	@EC	Not the without_versioning, no
2013-04-30 12:20:34	@EC	I’m thinking the process will be to start with the root document, Object#clone it, then walk the embedded relations and do the same
2013-04-30 12:21:05	@EC	The nice thing is it won’t conflict with Mongoid’s #clone since there’s no overriding
2013-04-30 12:21:29	@EC	And it’s all encapsulated inside the context of serving to duplicate a Creator document
2013-04-30 12:22:05	@EC	A negative is to Object#clone I’ll have to find some way around Mongoid’s #clone
2013-04-30 12:22:28	@EC	Right now I’m looking at the possibility of unbinding Object#clone and binding it to instances of the documents within DocumentCloner
2013-04-30 12:22:34	@EC	Am I crazy?
2013-04-30 12:25:10	greggroth	Have you checked out Issue#duplicate?
2013-04-30 12:25:24	greggroth	have you tried copying the version over there?
2013-04-30 12:25:46	@EC	How so?
2013-04-30 12:27:08	greggroth	it does `clone.tap` then sets the spreads.  When it assigns the spreads is there a way to go back and set the version again (outside of using `data=`)?
2013-04-30 12:27:31	@EC	Hmm…
2013-04-30 12:27:43	@EC	If we knew what the original version was we could
2013-04-30 12:27:53	@EC	Time to introduce the next problem :)
2013-04-30 12:27:58	greggroth	uh oh
2013-04-30 12:28:08	@EC	Back in duplication…
2013-04-30 12:28:24	@EC	…once we get past the version-bumping issue there’s a duplicate-ID issue.
2013-04-30 12:28:49	@EC	When cloning, Mongoid gives the root document a new #id but lets all of the embedded documents keep the same #id as the original.
2013-04-30 12:29:09	@EC	So we end up with two GoLives with the same #id on different Articles, for example.
2013-04-30 12:29:35	@EC	To fix that, Mongoid suggests overriding #clone with your own implementation.
2013-04-30 12:30:00	@EC	But that would mean after cloning the translations would not have the same identifier
2013-04-30 12:30:11	@EC	So I’m not sure of a reliable way to match them up with their originals
2013-04-30 12:30:19	@EC	To determine what the correct, original version number was
2013-04-30 12:30:28	greggroth	since GoLive is embedded, is there anything wrong with them having the same id?
2013-04-30 12:30:46	@EC	Yes. RetailMe Mac expects them to be unique objects.
2013-04-30 12:31:13	@EC	It has GoLives modeled as objects independent of the containing document.
2013-04-30 12:31:55	@EC	Which is fair. We’ve always provided unique IDs so I understand that expectation.
2013-04-30 12:32:28	greggroth	ok.
2013-04-30 12:34:51	@EC	I might be able to strip the IDs after setting the versions.
2013-04-30 12:35:06	@EC	But I *think* Mongoid disallows changing the ID once it is initially set.
2013-04-30 12:35:27	@EC	Although I bet there’s *some* way around that.
2013-04-30 12:36:03	greggroth	These are two tough problems.
2013-04-30 12:36:27	@EC	Glad it’s not just me
2013-04-30 12:36:55	@EC	IMO, the right thing to do is separate version bumping from data assignment
2013-04-30 12:37:18	@EC	But that also requires the most change
2013-04-30 12:37:21	@EC	And time
2013-04-30 12:37:36	greggroth	I definitely agree.  Coupling versioning to that method is no good.
2013-04-30 12:38:18	@EC	Version evaluation probably should have begun its life in its own class
2013-04-30 12:38:31	@EC	With updates from the API funneled through it
2013-04-30 12:39:49	greggroth	right
2013-04-30 12:40:04	greggroth	Let me think more about this over lunch.  I'll be back in 30
2013-04-30 12:40:08	@EC	k
2013-04-30 12:40:21	@EC	I’ll explore modeling a custom-clone-process 
2013-04-30 12:41:13	@EC	Thanks for your consideration
2013-04-30 13:22:47	@EC	Ohh early tests are looking good
2013-04-30 13:23:01	@EC	Of course…they looked good when I tried checking the persistence in data=
2013-04-30 13:42:26	greggroth	back from lunch.  No good ideas yet.
2013-04-30 13:45:02	@EC	Experimenting with this: https://code.apple.com/gist/516e5ded7010c72c2c7c
2013-04-30 13:45:08	@EC	So far it’s been fruitful
2013-04-30 13:46:11	@EC	It basically just replaces Mongoid’s custom implementation of #clone with Ruby’s original method
2013-04-30 13:46:34	@EC	The beautiful thing about Ruby’s #clone is that it calls #initialize_copy on the cloned object
2013-04-30 13:46:49	@EC	Giving you the opportunity to do any class-specific adjustments needed
2013-04-30 13:49:10	@EC	I suppose this is just a self-contained monkey-patch

2013-04-30 18:39:24	jonathanwallace	EC: reviewed
2013-04-30 18:39:26	jonathanwallace	very nice
2013-04-30 18:40:28	EC	Think it’s a good solution?
2013-04-30 18:45:58	jonathanwallace	yes, i do. i bemoan the fact that ruby doesn't make the separation between its internal structure and its external interface clearer
2013-04-30 18:49:07	EC	I’m not sure it would have helped if Ruby had :)
2013-04-30 18:50:11	EC	It occurred to me that the developer could have implemented this change originally (creating a separate reading and setting interface from the attribute getter and setter)
2013-04-30 18:50:39	EC	My guess is they didn’t forsee this kind of problem
2013-04-30 18:50:56	EC	And it was easier to just insert the behavior in the attribute setter
2013-04-30 18:52:09	jonathanwallace	yeah
2013-04-30 18:52:52	EC	I was hoping it could make the #conversions field private
2013-04-30 18:53:11	EC	To help encourage the separation
2013-04-30 18:53:25	EC	Although now that I think about it that could have been problematic, too

2013-05-06 13:53:11	@EC	QA is ready and chomping at the bit!
2013-05-06 13:54:22	jonathanwallace	i'm seeing 16 spec failures (8 on a pending PR from GR); and 10 cuke failures
2013-05-06 13:54:34	jonathanwallace	for the latest master jjonathanwallace/training_with_mongoid
2013-05-06 13:55:20	@EC	Uh oh. Spec failures?
2013-05-06 13:56:04	@EC	When I reviewed our state on Friday it appeared that the remaining failures were all related to the issue Gregg has been working on.
2013-05-06 13:56:17	@EC	Fingers crossed those all go away once we integrate his latest change.
2013-05-06 14:00:11	jonathanwallace	i'm assuming that greggroth PR will be a step forward in the cuke suite and working on the last 8 spec failures, which all have one root cause
2013-05-06 14:02:47	@EC	Cheers!

2013-05-06 16:26:29	@EC	Is it maybe an attempt to work around the behavior introduced in d2eaf9?

2013-05-06 16:28:32	@EC	greggroth: You may want to try reverting c2c220 on top of your d2eaf9 reversion and see if your failure count goes down
2013-05-06 16:28:51	@EC	I think c2c was a follow-up to d2e
2013-05-06 16:29:51	@EC	Actually, I’ll go ahead and try that out and let you know

2013-05-07 10:51:07	EC	2) The results if you apply the two reversions but don’t apply Gregg’s translations key rename
2013-05-07 10:51:12	EC	3) The results of applying all 3
2013-05-07 10:52:32	EC	And it’s pretty nice :)
2013-05-07 10:54:30	EC	Reverting the 2 commits re-introduces the grid_item_with_image failure
2013-05-07 10:54:43	EC	But applying the key rename resolves that failure without introducing any new failures
2013-05-07 10:58:20	jonathanwallace	excellent!
2013-05-07 10:58:30	jonathanwallace	is there a PR for the key rename?
2013-05-07 10:59:23	EC	It was in Gregg’s PR you committed

2013-05-07 11:00:53	jonathanwallace	those rspec failures have already been identified and i'm about to issue a PR for them
2013-05-07 11:07:41	EC	omg
2013-05-07 11:07:48	EC	Does that close out the failures then?
2013-05-07 11:12:48	jonathanwallace	it closes out thte rspec failures so we're back to the remaining cuke failures
2013-05-07 11:13:08	jonathanwallace	i'm not sure how it affects the cukes
2013-05-07 11:13:27	jonathanwallace	i believe that this PR will not affect the cukes positively or negatively
2013-05-07 11:16:35	EC	With the 2 reversions and key rename the cukes pass
2013-05-07 11:16:43	EC	So with no Rspecs left we should be done
2013-05-07 11:17:08	jonathanwallace	NO WAY
