2013-08-23 14:36:06	@ColdHotCool	If tyre wars came back, the manufacturers would just make a soft tyre that lasts forever that is the fastest
2013-08-23 14:36:11	+shap3	it generates a buttload of paddock drama
2013-08-23 14:36:11	@ColdHotCool	aka One stops
2013-08-23 14:36:48	+shap3	not if the governing body continues asking for compounds like this years
2013-08-23 14:37:02	@ColdHotCool	you can only do it with one manufacturer
2013-08-23 14:37:17	@ColdHotCool	it doesn't work with two or more
2013-08-23 14:37:41	+shap3	why not? if you present the same brief to twqo tyre manufacturers
2013-08-23 14:37:46	+shap3	two*
2013-08-23 14:38:33	@ColdHotCool	The problem is, they will battle against each other.  One tyre manufacturer will be better than the other, than the other will try to make theirs better and it's a race to the bottom
2013-08-23 14:39:07	@ColdHotCool	So you either get one stoppers back,  or everyone chooses one manufacturer
2013-08-23 14:40:46	+shap3	but isnt that what you want? a development race?
2013-08-23 14:40:53	@ColdHotCool	no
2013-08-23 14:40:57	+shap3	so long as the manufacturers stick to the brief

2013-08-23 14:45:24	+shap3	if you pitch two development teams against eachother over a uniform design brief, its going to highlight very quickly who met the brief the most effectively
2013-08-23 14:46:45	+shap3	developments in tyres arent going to move from 2/3 stop tyres to one stop tyres over the course of a year, theres not enough allowance for in season testing
2013-08-23 14:48:23	+MacGeek	why would pirelli develop their tyres in that direction, when they've been specifically asked to make tyres that wouldn't last much
2013-08-23 14:50:26	+shap3	you missed the first half of the conversation haha - we arent talking pirelli in specific, but if you were to give two tyre manufacturers this years design brief next year
2013-08-23 14:52:00	+MacGeek	I suspect you'd end up with a michelin-bridgestone scenario, where one supplier tailors their product for the most prominent team they won a contract for
2013-08-23 14:52:46	+shap3	im proposing the other way - the teams develop the car for a frozen tyre prototype
2013-08-23 14:52:57	+shap3	well - not a frozen prototype
2013-08-23 14:54:55	+shap3	just that the tyres cant exceed the guidelines set out for the manufacturer to follow
2013-08-23 14:55:30	+shap3	i guess now im thinking about it harder that would be difficult to enforce
2013-08-23 14:57:04	+MacGeek	it would be fun if they forced them to use road tyre compounds :p
2013-08-23 14:57:36	+MacGeek	I guess pirelli wouldn't have a problem with that - my last set of pirellis lasted about 7.5k miles
2013-08-23 14:58:18	+shap3	i guess i just want to see some more variety
2013-08-23 14:58:36	+shap3	it all seems very same same this season
2013-08-23 14:58:48	+shap3	to me
2013-08-23 14:59:09	+MacGeek	I'd like to see bigger diameter wheels, as first requested by pirelli - they'd have to rethink the whole brake regs, though
2013-08-23 14:59:48	+shap3	pirelli would like bigger wheels so they have lower profile sidewalls
2013-08-23 15:00:05	+shap3	that would make their developement more applicable to road applications
2013-08-23 15:00:10	+shap3	possibly
2013-08-23 15:04:13	+shap3	are pirelli producing tyres for any other forms of motorsport currently?
2013-08-23 15:05:03	+Bassy	maybe for the Carmageddong GP
2013-08-23 15:05:31	+henri200	shap3: they are producing tyres for a lot of different cars
2013-08-23 15:05:35	+henri200	and they will return to WRC next year i think

2013-08-23 15:06:52	+shap3	wrc is pretty irrelevant tyre-wise
2013-08-23 15:07:00	+MacGeek	as for the brakes, if they allowed bigger wheels, they could maybe ban carbon-carbon discs in favor of carbon-ceramics
2013-08-23 15:07:06	+MacGeek	which do have road car applications
2013-08-23 15:07:32	+shap3	but carbon-carbon brakes are so cooooool
2013-08-23 15:07:56	+MacGeek	carbonceramics aren't too shabby either :p

2013-08-23 15:09:37	+MacGeek	I believe they use old fashioned steel brakes
2013-08-23 15:09:45	+MacGeek	I surely remember p4/5c having steel brakes
2013-08-23 15:10:18	+shap3	i wonder if that a regulation or a reliability choice
2013-08-23 15:10:41	+MacGeek	not sure. what I do know is that it's surely a lot easier to measure brake disc wear on a steel disc
2013-08-23 15:10:52	+MacGeek	that's because carbon ceramic discs don't just have a minimum thickness

2013-08-23 15:10:56	+MacGeek	they also have a minimum weight
2013-08-23 15:11:02	+MacGeek	they can be thick enough, but still useless.
2013-08-23 15:11:24	+shap3	and brakes are unsprung weight
2013-08-23 15:11:42	+shap3	hmm
2013-08-23 15:11:48	+MacGeek	no, I mean that the wear is determined by the rotor weight
2013-08-23 15:11:57	+shap3	oh right
2013-08-23 15:12:09	+MacGeek	I've been explained that at high temperatures, basically the carbon evaporates out of the disc.
2013-08-23 15:12:22	+MacGeek	so it can be thick enough, but still qualify as a worn disc
2013-08-23 15:12:26	+shap3	O_O
2013-08-23 15:12:44	+MacGeek	my disc hats in fact do have a minimum weight printed on them.
2013-08-23 15:12:49	+MacGeek	in addition to a minimum thickness.
2013-08-23 15:12:57	+shap3	this reminds me
2013-08-23 15:13:13	+shap3	i need to flush/bleed and replace my brakes
2013-08-23 15:13:24	+MacGeek	https://www.dropbox.com/s/25jflu2807vsoxt/IMG_1239.JPG
2013-08-23 15:13:27	+MacGeek	you can see it here.
2013-08-23 15:14:24	+MacGeek	if it weighs less than 5384g, it must be replaced, even if it's thick enough.
2013-08-23 15:14:50	+MacGeek	that requires removing the disc, and I can imagine race teams not wanting to do that
2013-08-23 15:15:17	+shap3	in an endurance situation it wouldnt be too much of a major if they needed to
2013-08-23 15:15:40	+shap3	they do some crazy maintainance in le mans pitstops

2013-08-23 16:04:07	+shap3	then treat fuel like tyres in a qualifying sense, so you have to carry fuel loads to the grid
