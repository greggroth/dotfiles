2012-12-11 16:10:14	greggroth	it should submit the course for translation in that language also, but I may have missed that.
2012-12-11 16:12:16	@EC	In particular I’m referring to how the end-user signals the document should go to translation, not the process the server uses to connect and submit to WorldServer.
2012-12-11 16:12:57	greggroth	a course should infer which translations are required based on which locales it's lessons are part of.
2012-12-11 16:13:47	greggroth	i need to think of the best time to do that though.
2012-12-11 16:14:41	greggroth	just because a lesson is ready for translation doesn't mean the course is, so maybe it would be best to have the content creator send it for translation
2012-12-11 16:14:55	greggroth	and limit the available locales to the ones for which it has lessons in.

2012-12-12 09:47:34	EC	[18:21:45] What’s up?
2012-12-12 09:47:34	alindeman	[18:25:02] EC: There are some steps on intersect-train that have a nil template. Do you know what the importer should do about them? Training::Step.find_all_by_template(nil)
2012-12-12 09:47:34	alindeman	[18:25:14] EC: None of them have any step assets, so I'm thinking they may have arisen from a web creator bug
2012-12-12 09:47:34	alindeman	[18:25:22] EC: My gut reaction is that we ignore them b/c they don't actually have any content anyway
2012-12-12 09:47:34	alindeman	[18:25:29] EC: However, I wanted to get your thoughts
2012-12-12 09:47:34	EC	[18:25:40] Standby. Now I’m interrupted again.
2012-12-12 09:47:34	alindeman	[18:26:13] Sure
2012-12-12 09:47:34	EC	[18:34:52] Okay. They’ve gone.
2012-12-12 09:47:34	EC	[18:34:56] I hope.

2012-12-12 09:47:34	EC	[18:37:55] Huh. I’m not sure.
2012-12-12 09:47:34	EC	[18:37:59] Let me take a look at some of them.
2012-12-12 09:47:34	alindeman	[18:38:14] Sure
2012-12-12 09:47:34	EC	[18:39:15] Hmm
2012-12-12 09:47:34	EC	[18:39:39] When I run “SELECT DISTINCT template FROM training_steps;” on a production backup-derived database I don’t get any nils
2012-12-12 09:47:34	EC	[18:40:05] And 0 records from “SELECT * FROM training_steps WHERE template IS NULL;”
2012-12-12 09:47:34	EC	[18:40:15] Is it possible those are from an earlier migration attempt?
2012-12-12 09:47:34	EC	[18:40:48] Going to check production itself now.
2012-12-12 09:47:34	EC	[18:42:00] irb(main):002:0> Training::Step.find_all_by_template(nil).count
2012-12-12 09:47:34	EC	[18:42:01] => 0
2012-12-12 09:47:34	alindeman	[18:43:30] Hmm
2012-12-12 09:47:34	alindeman	[18:43:38] I haven't run the importer on intersect-train, so I don't /think/ so
2012-12-12 09:47:34	alindeman	[18:43:47] Maybe they are from a busted publication
2012-12-12 09:47:34	alindeman	[18:44:25] Some were created back in Oct, but many were recently
2012-12-12 09:47:34	EC	[18:45:58] It’s probably about time to reload the -train database from a production backup.
2012-12-12 09:47:34	alindeman	[18:46:58] That'd be awesome
2012-12-12 09:47:34	alindeman	[18:47:09] For now I will assume it's our bug
2012-12-12 09:47:34	alindeman	[18:47:11] Thanks EC
2012-12-12 09:47:34	EC	[19:07:42] alindeman: np!
2012-12-12 09:47:34	EC	[19:07:51] alindeman: Put that reload on my todos.
2012-12-12 09:47:34	alindeman	[19:11:55] Thanks
2012-12-12 09:47:34	alindeman	[19:12:01] Verified that steps w/o a template are OK
2012-12-12 09:47:34	alindeman	[19:12:10] We're no longer using template for newly published things
2012-12-12 09:47:34	alindeman	[19:12:18] Misfire! Thanks for listening

2012-12-12 10:28:02	alindeman	[18:26:13] Sure
2012-12-12 10:28:02	EC	[18:34:52] Okay. They’ve gone.
2012-12-12 10:28:02	EC	[18:34:56] I hope.
2012-12-12 10:28:02	alindeman	[18:36:19] Heh
2012-12-12 10:28:02	EC	[18:37:55] Huh. I’m not sure.
2012-12-12 10:28:02	EC	[18:37:59] Let me take a look at some of them.
2012-12-12 10:28:02	alindeman	[18:38:14] Sure
2012-12-12 10:28:02	EC	[18:39:15] Hmm
2012-12-12 10:28:02	EC	[18:39:39] When I run “SELECT DISTINCT template FROM training_steps;” on a production backup-derived database I don’t get any nils
2012-12-12 10:28:02	EC	[18:40:05] And 0 records from “SELECT * FROM training_steps WHERE template IS NULL;”
2012-12-12 10:28:02	EC	[18:40:15] Is it possible those are from an earlier migration attempt?
2012-12-12 10:28:02	EC	[18:40:48] Going to check production itself now.
2012-12-12 10:28:02	EC	[18:42:00] irb(main):002:0> Training::Step.find_all_by_template(nil).count
2012-12-12 10:28:02	EC	[18:42:01] => 0
2012-12-12 10:28:02	alindeman	[18:43:30] Hmm
2012-12-12 10:28:02	alindeman	[18:43:38] I haven't run the importer on intersect-train, so I don't /think/ so
2012-12-12 10:28:02	alindeman	[18:43:47] Maybe they are from a busted publication
2012-12-12 10:28:02	alindeman	[18:44:25] Some were created back in Oct, but many were recently
2012-12-12 10:28:02	EC	[18:45:58] It’s probably about time to reload the -train database from a production backup.
2012-12-12 10:28:02	alindeman	[18:46:58] That'd be awesome
2012-12-12 10:28:02	alindeman	[18:47:09] For now I will assume it's our bug
2012-12-12 10:28:02	alindeman	[18:47:11] Thanks EC
2012-12-12 10:28:02	EC	[19:07:42] alindeman: np!

2012-12-12 12:36:27	EC	[15:40:30] greggroth: Have you had a chance to review my last 2 emails on course localization, translation and publication?
2012-12-12 12:36:28	greggroth	[15:46:20] ah somehow I missed it.  *checking it out now*
2012-12-12 12:36:28	greggroth	[15:53:32] That plan looks like what I was thinking
2012-12-12 12:36:28	EC	[15:58:14] greggroth: Do the changes to the plan make sense? The ones Kennard added?
2012-12-12 12:36:28	EC	[15:58:29] Re: translation, localization UI in Mac?
2012-12-12 12:36:28	greggroth	[16:01:16] so the UI will show the content creator which countries the course will be published in (inferred from the lesson publication), but wont have any settings for the courses publication
2012-12-12 12:36:28	greggroth	[16:01:30] If I understand this correctly, it seems reasonable.
2012-12-12 12:36:28	greggroth	[16:02:14] maybe the way I say it doesn't really make sense...
2012-12-12 12:36:28	greggroth	[16:02:51] what I mean is that since course publication is determined by lesson publication, there aren't any settings for course publication that should be available on the Mac app (sunrise, sunset, etc).
2012-12-12 12:36:28	EC	[16:06:36] Yes
2012-12-12 12:36:28	EC	[16:06:40] That sounds right.
2012-12-12 12:36:28	EC	[16:06:53] And courses don’t need GoLives
2012-12-12 12:36:28	EC	[16:07:05] Mac will create “virtual GoLives”

2012-12-12 12:36:28	greggroth	[16:07:26] right
2012-12-12 12:36:28	EC	[16:07:33] Cool.
2012-12-12 12:36:28	EC	[16:07:36] Last question
2012-12-12 12:36:28	EC	[16:07:47] Does the translation request process make sense?
2012-12-12 12:36:28	EC	[16:08:24] (Email from 12/7, 10:27a)
2012-12-12 12:36:28	EC	[16:08:31] Whoops that’s PST
2012-12-12 12:36:28	greggroth	[16:09:43] hmmm I want to say the right thing happens, but I need to check.
2012-12-12 12:36:28	greggroth	[16:10:14] it should submit the course for translation in that language also, but I may have missed that.
2012-12-12 12:36:28	EC	[16:12:16] In particular I’m referring to how the end-user signals the document should go to translation, not the process the server uses to connect and submit to WorldServer.
2012-12-12 12:36:28	greggroth	[16:12:57] a course should infer which translations are required based on which locales it's lessons are part of.
2012-12-12 12:36:28	greggroth	[16:13:47] i need to think of the best time to do that though.
2012-12-12 12:36:28	greggroth	[16:14:41] just because a lesson is ready for translation doesn't mean the course is, so maybe it would be best to have the content creator send it for translation
2012-12-12 12:36:28	greggroth	[16:14:55] and limit the available locales to the ones for which it has lessons in.
2012-12-12 12:36:28	greggroth	[16:16:05] so in summary, when you send a lesson for translation to German, it should not affect the course.  The content creator for the course will separately send the course for translation in German.
2012-12-12 12:36:28	greggroth	[16:16:20] alindeman: does that sounds right to you?  ^
2012-12-12 12:36:28	alindeman	[16:16:35] I honestly don't know
2012-12-12 12:36:28	EC	[16:30:10] Sorry. Distracted. Will review latest after the meeting.

2012-12-12 14:29:09	@EC	[18:34:52] Okay. They’ve gone.
2012-12-12 14:29:09	@EC	[18:34:56] I hope.
2012-12-12 14:29:09	alindeman	[18:36:19] Heh
2012-12-12 14:29:09	@EC	[18:37:55] Huh. I’m not sure.
2012-12-12 14:29:09	@EC	[18:37:59] Let me take a look at some of them.
2012-12-12 14:29:09	alindeman	[18:38:14] Sure
2012-12-12 14:29:09	@EC	[18:39:15] Hmm
2012-12-12 14:29:09	@EC	[18:39:39] When I run “SELECT DISTINCT template FROM training_steps;” on a production backup-derived database I don’t get any nils
2012-12-12 14:29:09	@EC	[18:40:05] And 0 records from “SELECT * FROM training_steps WHERE template IS NULL;”
2012-12-12 14:29:09	@EC	[18:40:15] Is it possible those are from an earlier migration attempt?
2012-12-12 14:29:09	@EC	[18:40:48] Going to check production itself now.
2012-12-12 14:29:09	@EC	[18:42:00] irb(main):002:0> Training::Step.find_all_by_template(nil).count
2012-12-12 14:29:09	@EC	[18:42:01] => 0
2012-12-12 14:29:09	alindeman	[18:43:30] Hmm
2012-12-12 14:29:09	alindeman	[18:43:38] I haven't run the importer on intersect-train, so I don't /think/ so
2012-12-12 14:29:09	alindeman	[18:43:47] Maybe they are from a busted publication
2012-12-12 14:29:09	alindeman	[18:44:25] Some were created back in Oct, but many were recently
2012-12-12 14:29:09	@EC	[18:45:58] It’s probably about time to reload the -train database from a production backup.
2012-12-12 14:29:09	alindeman	[18:46:58] That'd be awesome
2012-12-12 14:29:09	alindeman	[18:47:09] For now I will assume it's our bug
2012-12-12 14:29:09	alindeman	[18:47:11] Thanks EC
2012-12-12 14:29:09	@EC	[19:07:42] alindeman: np!
2012-12-12 14:29:09	@EC	[19:07:51] alindeman: Put that reload on my todos.
2012-12-12 14:29:09	alindeman	[19:11:55] Thanks
2012-12-12 14:29:09	alindeman	[19:12:01] Verified that steps w/o a template are OK
2012-12-12 14:29:09	alindeman	[19:12:10] We're no longer using template for newly published things
2012-12-12 14:29:09	alindeman	[19:12:18] Misfire! Thanks for listening
2012-12-12 14:29:09	zdennis	[13:21:53] A pull request is ready for review when any one gets a chance. https://code.apple.com/RetailSoftwareEngineering/intersect/pull/290
2012-12-12 14:29:09	zdennis	[13:25:03] Another PR that is ready for review is for PT card 9463: https://code.apple.com/RetailSoftwareEngineering/intersect/pull/260
2012-12-12 14:29:09	@EC	[13:28:26] alindeman: Heard back from Goldberg re: non-uniform quizzes
2012-12-12 14:29:09	@EC	[13:28:46] alindeman: He described it as a lot of work but asked for a due date which I gave him
2012-12-12 14:29:09	@EC	[13:29:04] alindeman: Haven’t received a full commitment to clean those up but also haven’t received a “no”
2012-12-12 14:29:09	jonathanwallace1	[13:40:43] zdennis: i'll take a look at those after getting this commit out in the door in the next hour or so if that's okay
2012-12-12 14:29:09	zdennis	[13:41:16] jonathanwallace1: that'd be great. ty
2012-12-12 14:29:09	stevenharman	[14:28:36] EC: Questions re: testing iWorld stuff locally. Is it possible?
2012-12-12 14:29:09	***	Playback Complete.

2012-12-12 14:29:09	-#	Channel created on Fri, 05 Oct 2012 21:26:00
2012-12-12 14:29:52	stevenharman	I'm trying to figure out why not all translations are ending up in iWorld, and why others aren't being correctly merged back in.
2012-12-12 14:30:08	stevenharman	So I want to see what we (server-side) send to iWorld, and what we do with it when we get stuff back from them.
2012-12-12 14:44:18	@EC	stevenharman: Yes, totally possible.
2012-12-12 14:44:32	@EC	Usually, what I do is just modify the method that uploads the files…
2012-12-12 14:44:52	@EC	…and instead of having it make a request to an API, write the payload to a file on my disk.
2012-12-12 14:45:04	@EC	Make sense?
2012-12-12 14:47:09	stevenharman	Hmm... sounds like a nice place to use a strategy. So in `development` write to disk, else, UPLOAD!
2012-12-12 14:47:21	@EC	Maybe
2012-12-12 14:47:46	stevenharman	And then you have the job that fetches them back from iWorld read from disk instead, I suppose?
2012-12-12 14:49:04	@EC	Yep. If I’m testing from the other direction.
2012-12-12 14:49:18	@EC	Typically, I’m concerned about one direction or the other at the time.
2012-12-12 14:49:29	@EC	I’ve never had a need to set up a full cycle at once.
2012-12-12 14:50:01	@EC	Also, if you’re chasing a bug reported by QA you can ask those guys if they could get the iWorld XML files from Retail Translation
2012-12-12 14:50:13	@EC	Then use those as fixtures to be read by a RetrieveTranslationsJob
2012-12-12 14:50:45	stevenharman	Good call.
2012-12-12 14:50:58	@EC	Or just modify Client#download_and_extract_project to read from the file instead of request from a server
2012-12-12 14:51:25	stevenharman	I'm just getting back to tracking down the odd behavior we saw while trying to submit stuff to iWorld the other day. Where only some files were making it to the server.
2012-12-12 14:51:31	@EC	Yep.
2012-12-12 14:52:03	stevenharman	When I submit a Lesson that is in both France and Switzerland, we expect to see 2 files written, Yes?
2012-12-12 14:52:05	@EC	The other thing I find useful is dropping into the debugger at the beginning of a SendTranslationsJob and then stepping through every action 
2012-12-12 14:52:21	@EC	Three, I think
2012-12-12 14:52:27	@EC	Two French, one German
2012-12-12 14:52:37	@EC	fr-fr, de-CH, fr-CH
2012-12-12 14:53:05	@EC	Remember that fr-FR and fr-CH, while the same language, may have different localizations
2012-12-12 14:55:00	@EC	Standby
2012-12-12 14:58:33	stevenharman	Right.
2012-12-12 15:20:04	@EC	k back
2012-12-12 16:20:44	jonathanwallace1	zdennis: should i bias towards merging?  i've reviewed #260 and it looks good
2012-12-12 16:21:41	jonathanwallace1	zdennis: also, i haven't reviewed #290 yet but Github is reporting that it won't merge cleanly at the moment
2012-12-12 16:26:12	zdennis	jonathanwallace1: yah, merge away on 260! TY
2012-12-12 16:26:46	zdennis	jonathanwallace1: on 290, I haven't heard back from EC yet… EC, ping pong!
2012-12-12 16:27:07	jonathanwallace1	merged!
2012-12-12 16:28:13	zdennis	jonathanwallace1: I think you can merge 290 if you are okay with resolving a merge conflict. There's another branch in next-release that needs to be taken out (or at least not merged into master). 
2012-12-12 16:28:21	jonathanwallace1	zdennis: ah, i just read your comment on their
2012-12-12 16:28:31	jonathanwallace1	s/their/there!
2012-12-12 16:29:22	zdennis	it's a two line conflict though, I'd be happy to tell you which line to toss and what to keep
2012-12-12 16:29:29	zdennis	or if you want to wait until I hear back from EC, that works to
2012-12-12 16:31:35	jonathanwallace1	zdennis: 260 was supposed to be merged into master, correct?
2012-12-12 16:31:49	zdennis	no, next-release
2012-12-12 16:31:52	jonathanwallace1	uhoh
2012-12-12 16:32:05	zdennis	sorry, that PR was created before next-release took on its prominence
2012-12-12 16:32:32	jonathanwallace1	i shoulda caught that before merging but i didn't catch it until after
2012-12-12 16:32:43	zdennis	the commit master was at before was bd245409599d2d5b25189c987fd1753b2a519b79
2012-12-12 16:33:50	jonathanwallace1	i'm not sure how to back out of a github merge
2012-12-12 16:34:24	zdennis	jonathanwallace1: in the past I just reset master back to the good commit using reset --hard 
2012-12-12 16:34:30	zdennis	and then force push master
2012-12-12 16:34:45	jonathanwallace1	what will that do to the PR?
2012-12-12 16:34:50	zdennis	i don't think anything
2012-12-12 16:34:53	jonathanwallace1	k
2012-12-12 16:34:57	jonathanwallace1	doing that now
2012-12-12 16:34:59	zdennis	since it's closed, it's kind of in a frozen stable i believe
2012-12-12 16:35:52	zdennis	*state
2012-12-12 16:37:10	zdennis	jonathanwallace1: do you want to do a manual merge --no-ff into next-release for that branch or would you like me to open a new PR (I'll see if I can re-open 260) ?
2012-12-12 16:37:34	zdennis	jonathanwallace1: cool, my local master is now back in sync with remote master.  master looks good
2012-12-12 16:37:38	jonathanwallace1	i've restored master to its appropriate state
2012-12-12 16:37:41	jonathanwallace1	cool
2012-12-12 16:37:57	@EC	zdennis: Is this in regards to your email?
2012-12-12 16:38:19	jonathanwallace1	open a new PR to stick with the same work flow
2012-12-12 16:38:29	jonathanwallace1	or #260 if you can re-open
2012-12-12 16:38:36	zdennis	EC: yeah for PR 290. To merge and resolve now, or to wait and restore next-release to pristinity.
2012-12-12 16:38:50	@EC	I’ll read it now.

2012-12-12 16:43:20	zdennis	EC: let me know if any questions or if just to tell me that nothing what I wrote makes sense. 
2012-12-12 16:43:23	zdennis	thx jonathanwallace1

2012-12-12 16:47:50	zdennis	jonathanwallace1: for PR 290, I think we're good if you can merge and resolve that conflict locally before pushing up to next-release

2012-12-12 16:56:45	jonathanwallace1	nice
2012-12-12 17:01:21	zdennis	jonathanwallace1: I added a comment on PR 290 about the conflict resolution in case I'm not around I don't want to hold you up if you get a chance to review it
2012-12-12 17:09:04	stevenharman	EC: What is the difference b/t "Publication Status" of "Unpublished" and "Drafted"?
2012-12-12 17:14:27	<--	zdennis (~zdennis@17.113.8.164) has quit (Quit: zdennis)
2012-12-12 17:18:42	@EC	stevenharman: Does “Unpublished” appear only in the UI or is it also a state in a state machine somewhere?
2012-12-12 17:18:52	stevenharman	UI
2012-12-12 17:19:12	stevenharman	it may also be elsewhere, but I was curious about it in the UI.
2012-12-12 17:19:32	@EC	I’m not sure.
2012-12-12 17:19:34	stevenharman	I was trying to submit a lesson (in france and Switzerland) for translation, and only one was "sent"
2012-12-12 17:19:41	stevenharman	The other said "Pending Globalization"
2012-12-12 17:20:06	stevenharman	I was screwing around in the UI a lot, so maybe I got it into some weird state that I don't understand. I just started anew with a clean Lesson.
2012-12-12 17:20:08	@EC	My best guess is that maybe the client is using “Unpublished” to mean the document is no longer in a published state and is past its sunset time?
2012-12-12 17:20:24	stevenharman	These lessons have no sunset.
2012-12-12 17:20:26	@EC	Try tossing that question to the Mac team.
2012-12-12 17:20:47	@EC	I only know a “published” state server-side.
2012-12-12 17:22:09	@EC	Just asked Kenny, too
2012-12-12 17:22:41	@EC	According to Kennard
2012-12-12 17:22:53	@EC	The client is interpreting the state machine state for the GoLive
2012-12-12 17:23:04	@EC	And “approved” is mapped to “Unpublished”
2012-12-12 17:23:11	@EC	(He’s going to take care of that.)
2012-12-12 17:24:24	@EC	Does that help?

2012-12-13 07:46:25	EC	[14:06:22] What was that training retrospective like for you guys?
2012-12-13 07:46:25	EC	[15:40:30] greggroth: Have you had a chance to review my last 2 emails on course localization, translation and publication?
2012-12-13 07:46:26	greggroth	[15:46:20] ah somehow I missed it.  *checking it out now*
2012-12-13 07:46:26	greggroth	[15:53:32] That plan looks like what I was thinking
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[15:58:14] greggroth: Do the changes to the plan make sense? The ones Kennard added?
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[15:58:29] Re: translation, localization UI in Mac?
2012-12-13 07:46:26	greggroth	[16:01:16] so the UI will show the content creator which countries the course will be published in (inferred from the lesson publication), but wont have any settings for the courses publication
2012-12-13 07:46:26	greggroth	[16:01:30] If I understand this correctly, it seems reasonable.
2012-12-13 07:46:26	greggroth	[16:02:14] maybe the way I say it doesn't really make sense...
2012-12-13 07:46:26	greggroth	[16:02:51] what I mean is that since course publication is determined by lesson publication, there aren't any settings for course publication that should be available on the Mac app (sunrise, sunset, etc).
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[16:06:36] Yes
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[16:06:40] That sounds right.
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[16:06:53] And courses don’t need GoLives
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[16:07:05] Mac will create “virtual GoLives”
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[16:07:10] For display only
2012-12-13 07:46:26	greggroth	[16:07:26] right
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[16:07:33] Cool.
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[16:07:36] Last question
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[16:07:47] Does the translation request process make sense?
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[16:08:24] (Email from 12/7, 10:27a)
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[16:08:31] Whoops that’s PST
2012-12-13 07:46:26	greggroth	[16:09:43] hmmm I want to say the right thing happens, but I need to check.
2012-12-13 07:46:26	greggroth	[16:10:14] it should submit the course for translation in that language also, but I may have missed that.
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[16:12:16] In particular I’m referring to how the end-user signals the document should go to translation, not the process the server uses to connect and submit to WorldServer.
2012-12-13 07:46:26	greggroth	[16:12:57] a course should infer which translations are required based on which locales it's lessons are part of.
2012-12-13 07:46:26	greggroth	[16:13:47] i need to think of the best time to do that though.
2012-12-13 07:46:26	greggroth	[16:14:41] just because a lesson is ready for translation doesn't mean the course is, so maybe it would be best to have the content creator send it for translation
2012-12-13 07:46:26	greggroth	[16:14:55] and limit the available locales to the ones for which it has lessons in.
2012-12-13 07:46:26	greggroth	[16:16:05] so in summary, when you send a lesson for translation to German, it should not affect the course.  The content creator for the course will separately send the course for translation in German.
2012-12-13 07:46:26	greggroth	[16:16:20] alindeman: does that sounds right to you?  ^
2012-12-13 07:46:26	alindeman	[16:16:35] I honestly don't know
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[16:30:10] Sorry. Distracted. Will review latest after the meeting.
2012-12-13 07:46:26	greggroth	[16:34:37] sounds good.  Let me know if that procedure doesn't make sense.  Thanks!
2012-12-13 07:46:26	zdennis	[17:30:37] EC: you around?
2012-12-13 07:46:26	zdennis	[17:33:45] I'll send you a quick email, because I might sign off shortly and not be around for your reply. It's regarding branch 9518 and next-release.
2012-12-13 07:46:26	alindeman	[17:54:12] EC: Around?
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[18:21:41] I’m here!
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[18:21:45] What’s up?
2012-12-13 07:46:26	alindeman	[18:25:02] EC: There are some steps on intersect-train that have a nil template. Do you know what the importer should do about them? Training::Step.find_all_by_template(nil)
2012-12-13 07:46:26	alindeman	[18:25:14] EC: None of them have any step assets, so I'm thinking they may have arisen from a web creator bug
2012-12-13 07:46:26	alindeman	[18:25:22] EC: My gut reaction is that we ignore them b/c they don't actually have any content anyway
2012-12-13 07:46:26	alindeman	[18:25:29] EC: However, I wanted to get your thoughts
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[18:25:40] Standby. Now I’m interrupted again.
2012-12-13 07:46:26	alindeman	[18:26:13] Sure
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[18:34:52] Okay. They’ve gone.
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[18:34:56] I hope.
2012-12-13 07:46:26	alindeman	[18:36:19] Heh
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[18:37:55] Huh. I’m not sure.
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[18:37:59] Let me take a look at some of them.
2012-12-13 07:46:26	alindeman	[18:38:14] Sure
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[18:39:15] Hmm
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[18:39:39] When I run “SELECT DISTINCT template FROM training_steps;” on a production backup-derived database I don’t get any nils
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[18:40:05] And 0 records from “SELECT * FROM training_steps WHERE template IS NULL;”
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[18:40:15] Is it possible those are from an earlier migration attempt?
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[18:40:48] Going to check production itself now.
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[18:42:00] irb(main):002:0> Training::Step.find_all_by_template(nil).count
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[18:42:01] => 0
2012-12-13 07:46:26	alindeman	[18:43:30] Hmm
2012-12-13 07:46:26	alindeman	[18:43:38] I haven't run the importer on intersect-train, so I don't /think/ so
2012-12-13 07:46:26	alindeman	[18:43:47] Maybe they are from a busted publication
2012-12-13 07:46:26	alindeman	[18:44:25] Some were created back in Oct, but many were recently
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[18:45:58] It’s probably about time to reload the -train database from a production backup.
2012-12-13 07:46:26	alindeman	[18:46:58] That'd be awesome
2012-12-13 07:46:26	alindeman	[18:47:09] For now I will assume it's our bug
2012-12-13 07:46:26	alindeman	[18:47:11] Thanks EC
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[19:07:42] alindeman: np!
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[19:07:51] alindeman: Put that reload on my todos.
2012-12-13 07:46:26	alindeman	[19:11:55] Thanks
2012-12-13 07:46:26	alindeman	[19:12:01] Verified that steps w/o a template are OK
2012-12-13 07:46:26	alindeman	[19:12:10] We're no longer using template for newly published things
2012-12-13 07:46:26	alindeman	[19:12:18] Misfire! Thanks for listening
2012-12-13 07:46:26	zdennis	[13:21:53] A pull request is ready for review when any one gets a chance. https://code.apple.com/RetailSoftwareEngineering/intersect/pull/290
2012-12-13 07:46:26	zdennis	[13:25:03] Another PR that is ready for review is for PT card 9463: https://code.apple.com/RetailSoftwareEngineering/intersect/pull/260
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[13:28:26] alindeman: Heard back from Goldberg re: non-uniform quizzes
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[13:28:46] alindeman: He described it as a lot of work but asked for a due date which I gave him
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[13:29:04] alindeman: Haven’t received a full commitment to clean those up but also haven’t received a “no”
2012-12-13 07:46:26	jonathanwallace1	[13:40:43] zdennis: i'll take a look at those after getting this commit out in the door in the next hour or so if that's okay
2012-12-13 07:46:26	zdennis	[13:41:16] jonathanwallace1: that'd be great. ty
2012-12-13 07:46:26	stevenharman	[14:28:36] EC: Questions re: testing iWorld stuff locally. Is it possible?
2012-12-13 07:46:26	stevenharman	[14:29:51] I'm trying to figure out why not all translations are ending up in iWorld, and why others aren't being correctly merged back in.
2012-12-13 07:46:26	stevenharman	[14:30:08] So I want to see what we (server-side) send to iWorld, and what we do with it when we get stuff back from them.
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[14:44:18] stevenharman: Yes, totally possible.
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[14:44:32] Usually, what I do is just modify the method that uploads the files…
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[14:44:52] …and instead of having it make a request to an API, write the payload to a file on my disk.
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[14:45:04] Make sense?
2012-12-13 07:46:26	stevenharman	[14:47:09] Hmm... sounds like a nice place to use a strategy. So in `development` write to disk, else, UPLOAD!
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[14:47:21] Maybe
2012-12-13 07:46:26	stevenharman	[14:47:46] And then you have the job that fetches them back from iWorld read from disk instead, I suppose?
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[14:49:04] Yep. If I’m testing from the other direction.
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[14:49:18] Typically, I’m concerned about one direction or the other at the time.
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[14:49:28] I’ve never had a need to set up a full cycle at once.
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[14:50:01] Also, if you’re chasing a bug reported by QA you can ask those guys if they could get the iWorld XML files from Retail Translation
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[14:50:13] Then use those as fixtures to be read by a RetrieveTranslationsJob
2012-12-13 07:46:26	stevenharman	[14:50:45] Good call.
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[14:50:58] Or just modify Client#download_and_extract_project to read from the file instead of request from a server
2012-12-13 07:46:26	stevenharman	[14:51:25] I'm just getting back to tracking down the odd behavior we saw while trying to submit stuff to iWorld the other day. Where only some files were making it to the server.
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[14:51:31] Yep.
2012-12-13 07:46:26	stevenharman	[14:52:03] When I submit a Lesson that is in both France and Switzerland, we expect to see 2 files written, Yes?
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[14:52:05] The other thing I find useful is dropping into the debugger at the beginning of a SendTranslationsJob and then stepping through every action 
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[14:52:21] Three, I think
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[14:52:27] Two French, one German
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[14:52:37] fr-fr, de-CH, fr-CH
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[14:53:05] Remember that fr-FR and fr-CH, while the same language, may have different localizations
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[14:55:00] Standby
2012-12-13 07:46:26	stevenharman	[14:58:33] Right.
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[15:20:04] k back
2012-12-13 07:46:26	jonathanwallace1	[16:20:44] zdennis: should i bias towards merging?  i've reviewed #260 and it looks good
2012-12-13 07:46:26	jonathanwallace1	[16:21:41] zdennis: also, i haven't reviewed #290 yet but Github is reporting that it won't merge cleanly at the moment
2012-12-13 07:46:26	zdennis	[16:26:12] jonathanwallace1: yah, merge away on 260! TY
2012-12-13 07:46:26	zdennis	[16:26:46] jonathanwallace1: on 290, I haven't heard back from EC yet… EC, ping pong!
2012-12-13 07:46:26	jonathanwallace1	[16:27:07] merged!
2012-12-13 07:46:26	zdennis	[16:28:13] jonathanwallace1: I think you can merge 290 if you are okay with resolving a merge conflict. There's another branch in next-release that needs to be taken out (or at least not merged into master). 
2012-12-13 07:46:26	jonathanwallace1	[16:28:21] zdennis: ah, i just read your comment on their
2012-12-13 07:46:26	jonathanwallace1	[16:28:31] s/their/there!
2012-12-13 07:46:26	zdennis	[16:29:22] it's a two line conflict though, I'd be happy to tell you which line to toss and what to keep
2012-12-13 07:46:26	zdennis	[16:29:29] or if you want to wait until I hear back from EC, that works to
2012-12-13 07:46:26	jonathanwallace1	[16:31:35] zdennis: 260 was supposed to be merged into master, correct?
2012-12-13 07:46:26	zdennis	[16:31:49] no, next-release
2012-12-13 07:46:26	jonathanwallace1	[16:31:52] uhoh
2012-12-13 07:46:26	zdennis	[16:32:05] sorry, that PR was created before next-release took on its prominence
2012-12-13 07:46:26	jonathanwallace1	[16:32:32] i shoulda caught that before merging but i didn't catch it until after
2012-12-13 07:46:26	zdennis	[16:32:43] the commit master was at before was bd245409599d2d5b25189c987fd1753b2a519b79
2012-12-13 07:46:26	jonathanwallace1	[16:33:50] i'm not sure how to back out of a github merge
2012-12-13 07:46:26	zdennis	[16:34:24] jonathanwallace1: in the past I just reset master back to the good commit using reset --hard 
2012-12-13 07:46:26	zdennis	[16:34:30] and then force push master
2012-12-13 07:46:26	jonathanwallace1	[16:34:45] what will that do to the PR?
2012-12-13 07:46:26	zdennis	[16:34:50] i don't think anything
2012-12-13 07:46:26	jonathanwallace1	[16:34:53] k
2012-12-13 07:46:26	jonathanwallace1	[16:34:57] doing that now
2012-12-13 07:46:26	zdennis	[16:34:59] since it's closed, it's kind of in a frozen stable i believe
2012-12-13 07:46:26	zdennis	[16:35:52] *state
2012-12-13 07:46:26	zdennis	[16:37:10] jonathanwallace1: do you want to do a manual merge --no-ff into next-release for that branch or would you like me to open a new PR (I'll see if I can re-open 260) ?
2012-12-13 07:46:26	zdennis	[16:37:34] jonathanwallace1: cool, my local master is now back in sync with remote master.  master looks good
2012-12-13 07:46:26	jonathanwallace1	[16:37:38] i've restored master to its appropriate state
2012-12-13 07:46:26	jonathanwallace1	[16:37:41] cool
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[16:37:57] zdennis: Is this in regards to your email?
2012-12-13 07:46:26	jonathanwallace1	[16:38:19] open a new PR to stick with the same work flow
2012-12-13 07:46:26	jonathanwallace1	[16:38:29] or #260 if you can re-open
2012-12-13 07:46:26	zdennis	[16:38:36] EC: yeah for PR 290. To merge and resolve now, or to wait and restore next-release to pristinity.
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[16:38:50] I’ll read it now.
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[16:39:56] Never mind my never mind
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[16:39:58] lol
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[16:40:23] I’m trying to process the problem
2012-12-13 07:46:26	zdennis	[16:42:21] jonathanwallace1: https://code.apple.com/RetailSoftwareEngineering/intersect/pull/292
2012-12-13 07:46:26	jonathanwallace1	[16:42:58] zdennis: merged!
2012-12-13 07:46:26	zdennis	[16:43:20] EC: let me know if any questions or if just to tell me that nothing what I wrote makes sense. 
2012-12-13 07:46:26	zdennis	[16:43:23] thx jonathanwallace1 
2012-12-13 07:46:26	zdennis	[16:44:36] jonathanwallace1: who is charles quinn?
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[16:45:19] zdennis: Replied.
2012-12-13 07:46:26	zdennis	[16:45:28] thnx EC 
2012-12-13 07:46:26	jonathanwallace1	[16:45:35] zdennis: the CEO of Highgroove/Big Nerd Ranch
2012-12-13 07:46:26	jonathanwallace1	[16:45:40] all my credentials expired :(
2012-12-13 07:46:26	zdennis	[16:46:02] leading a double life eh?
2012-12-13 07:46:26	jonathanwallace1	[16:46:05] he's got some commits here and there backfrom when we first came on the project and his credentials haven't expired
2012-12-13 07:46:26	jonathanwallace1	[16:46:14] pretty much
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[16:46:20] No, Mark just put him out on the street.
2012-12-13 07:46:26	jonathanwallace1	[16:46:50] is hard living on the streets
2012-12-13 07:46:26	jonathanwallace1	[16:47:15] :)
2012-12-13 07:46:26	zdennis	[16:47:29] jonathanwallace1: I imagine something like this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wN0xK6bgQkQ
2012-12-13 07:46:26	zdennis	[16:47:50] jonathanwallace1: for PR 290, I think we're good if you can merge and resolve that conflict locally before pushing up to next-release
2012-12-13 07:46:26	jonathanwallace1	[16:48:43] haha, that song definitely sums up the difficulties of my programmer life 'cept
2012-12-13 07:46:26	jonathanwallace1	[16:48:51] they left out the part where my fingers get cold in winter
2012-12-13 07:46:26	greggroth	[16:52:29] jonathanwallace1: http://www.amazon.com/Ra-Key-Radiant-Keyboard-Desktop-Heater/dp/B006TMKLSO
2012-12-13 07:46:26	greggroth	[16:52:42] I honestly didn't know it was a thing, but now I want one.
2012-12-13 07:46:26	jonathanwallace1	[16:56:45] nice
2012-12-13 07:46:26	zdennis	[17:01:21] jonathanwallace1: I added a comment on PR 290 about the conflict resolution in case I'm not around I don't want to hold you up if you get a chance to review it
2012-12-13 07:46:26	stevenharman	[17:09:04] EC: What is the difference b/t "Publication Status" of "Unpublished" and "Drafted"?
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[17:18:42] stevenharman: Does “Unpublished” appear only in the UI or is it also a state in a state machine somewhere?
2012-12-13 07:46:26	stevenharman	[17:18:52] UI
2012-12-13 07:46:26	stevenharman	[17:19:12] it may also be elsewhere, but I was curious about it in the UI.
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[17:19:32] I’m not sure.
2012-12-13 07:46:26	stevenharman	[17:19:34] I was trying to submit a lesson (in france and Switzerland) for translation, and only one was "sent"
2012-12-13 07:46:26	stevenharman	[17:19:41] The other said "Pending Globalization"
2012-12-13 07:46:26	stevenharman	[17:20:06] I was screwing around in the UI a lot, so maybe I got it into some weird state that I don't understand. I just started anew with a clean Lesson.
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[17:20:08] My best guess is that maybe the client is using “Unpublished” to mean the document is no longer in a published state and is past its sunset time?
2012-12-13 07:46:26	stevenharman	[17:20:24] These lessons have no sunset.
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[17:20:26] Try tossing that question to the Mac team.
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[17:20:47] I only know a “published” state server-side.
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[17:22:09] Just asked Kenny, too
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[17:22:41] According to Kennard
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[17:22:53] The client is interpreting the state machine state for the GoLive
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[17:23:04] And “approved” is mapped to “Unpublished”
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[17:23:11] (He’s going to take care of that.)
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[17:24:24] Does that help?
2012-12-13 07:46:26	stevenharman	[17:36:27] Yeah, I was mostly just confused.
2012-12-13 07:46:26	stevenharman	[17:37:34] Oh... and I found something.
2012-12-13 07:46:26	stevenharman	[17:38:10] Do you remember how we used to put the `requested_locale` and `submitted_locale` into the XML we sent to iWorld? But we don't do that any more b/c it's not actually used...
2012-12-13 07:46:26	stevenharman	[17:38:31] EC ^
2012-12-13 07:46:26	stevenharman	[17:40:25] without having those in there we could end up with the exact same content in the XML file (assuming you didn't add any localizations or whatever). Yes?
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[17:40:30] Yes, I do
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[17:40:35] Yep
2012-12-13 07:46:26	stevenharman	[17:40:46] And if the content is the same, then they'll hash the same, so they'll have the same "filename"
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[17:40:49] It was probably added for human use only :)
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[17:40:54] Ohhhhhh
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[17:40:59] I never thought about that!
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[17:41:10] Dammit
2012-12-13 07:46:26	stevenharman	[17:41:20] Yeah.
2012-12-13 07:46:26	stevenharman	[17:41:40] I'm thinking that might be why we only saw 1 file make it to iWorld when we expected 3
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[17:41:46] Yep
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[17:41:49] That makes complete sense
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[17:41:57] And is so obvious now
2012-12-13 07:46:26	stevenharman	[17:42:00] I'm thinking I'll add a NEW key in each doc, but with a very obvious name.
2012-12-13 07:46:26	stevenharman	[17:42:22] So we don't delete it again :)
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[17:42:29] I wouldn’t mind the submitted locale being re-added to the XML, too.
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[17:42:48] When you’re looking through the files on Retail Translation’s side it’s the only way to identify what RetailMe locale you’re working with
2012-12-13 07:46:26	stevenharman	[17:42:51] Sure, but maybe with "better" names so we know why the heck they are there.
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[17:42:55] Yep
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[17:43:14] I agree do the keying/file naming in a way that is more evident, though
2012-12-13 07:46:26	EC	[17:43:26] Good find
2012-12-13 07:46:26	stevenharman	[17:47:10] Thanks.

2012-12-13 16:05:05	@EC	You should get an S/MIME certificate so we can exchange encrypted mail.
2012-12-13 16:05:29	@EC	Mac OS X Mail makes it painless to use S/MIME once you have the certificate installed.
2012-12-13 16:06:22	@EC	I just sent a document to Greggory that doesn’t contain any top-secret Apple plans but that could be damaging to Apple if intercepted.
2012-12-13 16:06:45	@EC	Since we’re using your non-Apple accounts that’s traveling over the public network.
2012-12-13 16:07:37	zdennis	okay sounds good
2012-12-13 16:08:12	@EC	Done that before?

2012-12-13 16:09:32	@EC	Great
2012-12-13 16:14:03	greggroth	I use sparrow
2012-12-13 16:31:41	@EC	What is S/MIME support like?
2012-12-13 16:40:40	greggroth	I believe nonexistent
2012-12-13 16:40:52	greggroth	I can use mail.app for my apple mail though if its important

2012-12-13 16:43:30	@EC	If the risk is high enough and I need to ensure its protection I will either deliver to your apple.com address or send it to you using Attaché
2012-12-13 16:43:49	greggroth	sounds good.
2012-12-13 16:44:04	greggroth	I'm heading home for the day.  See y'all tomorrow!
2012-12-13 16:44:06	@EC	S/MIME is a nice-to-have that mitigates the risk a little more

2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[14:06:22] What was that training retrospective like for you guys?
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[15:40:30] greggroth: Have you had a chance to review my last 2 emails on course localization, translation and publication?
2012-12-14 09:21:20	greggroth	[15:46:20] ah somehow I missed it.  *checking it out now*
2012-12-14 09:21:20	greggroth	[15:53:32] That plan looks like what I was thinking
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[15:58:14] greggroth: Do the changes to the plan make sense? The ones Kennard added?
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[15:58:29] Re: translation, localization UI in Mac?
2012-12-14 09:21:20	greggroth	[16:01:16] so the UI will show the content creator which countries the course will be published in (inferred from the lesson publication), but wont have any settings for the courses publication
2012-12-14 09:21:20	greggroth	[16:01:30] If I understand this correctly, it seems reasonable.
2012-12-14 09:21:20	greggroth	[16:02:14] maybe the way I say it doesn't really make sense...
2012-12-14 09:21:20	greggroth	[16:02:51] what I mean is that since course publication is determined by lesson publication, there aren't any settings for course publication that should be available on the Mac app (sunrise, sunset, etc).
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[16:06:36] Yes
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[16:06:40] That sounds right.
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[16:06:53] And courses don’t need GoLives
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[16:07:05] Mac will create “virtual GoLives”
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[16:07:10] For display only
2012-12-14 09:21:20	greggroth	[16:07:26] right
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[16:07:33] Cool.
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[16:07:36] Last question
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[16:07:47] Does the translation request process make sense?
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[16:08:24] (Email from 12/7, 10:27a)
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[16:08:31] Whoops that’s PST
2012-12-14 09:21:20	greggroth	[16:09:43] hmmm I want to say the right thing happens, but I need to check.
2012-12-14 09:21:20	greggroth	[16:10:14] it should submit the course for translation in that language also, but I may have missed that.
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[16:12:16] In particular I’m referring to how the end-user signals the document should go to translation, not the process the server uses to connect and submit to WorldServer.
2012-12-14 09:21:20	greggroth	[16:12:57] a course should infer which translations are required based on which locales it's lessons are part of.
2012-12-14 09:21:20	greggroth	[16:13:47] i need to think of the best time to do that though.
2012-12-14 09:21:20	greggroth	[16:14:41] just because a lesson is ready for translation doesn't mean the course is, so maybe it would be best to have the content creator send it for translation
2012-12-14 09:21:20	greggroth	[16:14:55] and limit the available locales to the ones for which it has lessons in.
2012-12-14 09:21:20	greggroth	[16:16:05] so in summary, when you send a lesson for translation to German, it should not affect the course.  The content creator for the course will separately send the course for translation in German.
2012-12-14 09:21:20	greggroth	[16:16:20] alindeman: does that sounds right to you?  ^
2012-12-14 09:21:20	alindeman	[16:16:35] I honestly don't know
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[16:30:10] Sorry. Distracted. Will review latest after the meeting.
2012-12-14 09:21:20	greggroth	[16:34:37] sounds good.  Let me know if that procedure doesn't make sense.  Thanks!
2012-12-14 09:21:20	zdennis	[17:30:37] EC: you around?
2012-12-14 09:21:20	zdennis	[17:33:45] I'll send you a quick email, because I might sign off shortly and not be around for your reply. It's regarding branch 9518 and next-release.
2012-12-14 09:21:20	alindeman	[17:54:12] EC: Around?
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[18:21:41] I’m here!
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[18:21:45] What’s up?
2012-12-14 09:21:20	alindeman	[18:25:02] EC: There are some steps on intersect-train that have a nil template. Do you know what the importer should do about them? Training::Step.find_all_by_template(nil)
2012-12-14 09:21:20	alindeman	[18:25:14] EC: None of them have any step assets, so I'm thinking they may have arisen from a web creator bug
2012-12-14 09:21:20	alindeman	[18:25:22] EC: My gut reaction is that we ignore them b/c they don't actually have any content anyway
2012-12-14 09:21:20	alindeman	[18:25:29] EC: However, I wanted to get your thoughts
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[18:25:40] Standby. Now I’m interrupted again.
2012-12-14 09:21:20	alindeman	[18:26:13] Sure
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[18:34:52] Okay. They’ve gone.
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[18:34:56] I hope.
2012-12-14 09:21:20	alindeman	[18:36:19] Heh
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[18:37:55] Huh. I’m not sure.
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[18:37:59] Let me take a look at some of them.
2012-12-14 09:21:20	alindeman	[18:38:14] Sure
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[18:39:15] Hmm
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[18:39:39] When I run “SELECT DISTINCT template FROM training_steps;” on a production backup-derived database I don’t get any nils
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[18:40:05] And 0 records from “SELECT * FROM training_steps WHERE template IS NULL;”
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[18:40:15] Is it possible those are from an earlier migration attempt?
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[18:40:48] Going to check production itself now.
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[18:42:00] irb(main):002:0> Training::Step.find_all_by_template(nil).count
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[18:42:01] => 0
2012-12-14 09:21:20	alindeman	[18:43:30] Hmm
2012-12-14 09:21:20	alindeman	[18:43:38] I haven't run the importer on intersect-train, so I don't /think/ so
2012-12-14 09:21:20	alindeman	[18:43:47] Maybe they are from a busted publication
2012-12-14 09:21:20	alindeman	[18:44:25] Some were created back in Oct, but many were recently
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[18:45:58] It’s probably about time to reload the -train database from a production backup.
2012-12-14 09:21:20	alindeman	[18:46:58] That'd be awesome
2012-12-14 09:21:20	alindeman	[18:47:09] For now I will assume it's our bug
2012-12-14 09:21:20	alindeman	[18:47:11] Thanks EC
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[19:07:42] alindeman: np!
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[19:07:51] alindeman: Put that reload on my todos.
2012-12-14 09:21:20	alindeman	[19:11:55] Thanks
2012-12-14 09:21:20	alindeman	[19:12:01] Verified that steps w/o a template are OK
2012-12-14 09:21:20	alindeman	[19:12:10] We're no longer using template for newly published things
2012-12-14 09:21:20	alindeman	[19:12:18] Misfire! Thanks for listening

2012-12-14 09:21:20	stevenharman	[14:28:36] EC: Questions re: testing iWorld stuff locally. Is it possible?
2012-12-14 09:21:20	stevenharman	[14:29:51] I'm trying to figure out why not all translations are ending up in iWorld, and why others aren't being correctly merged back in.
2012-12-14 09:21:20	stevenharman	[14:30:08] So I want to see what we (server-side) send to iWorld, and what we do with it when we get stuff back from them.
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[14:44:18] stevenharman: Yes, totally possible.
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[14:44:32] Usually, what I do is just modify the method that uploads the files…
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[14:44:52] …and instead of having it make a request to an API, write the payload to a file on my disk.
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[14:45:04] Make sense?
2012-12-14 09:21:20	stevenharman	[14:47:09] Hmm... sounds like a nice place to use a strategy. So in `development` write to disk, else, UPLOAD!
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[14:47:21] Maybe
2012-12-14 09:21:20	stevenharman	[14:47:46] And then you have the job that fetches them back from iWorld read from disk instead, I suppose?
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[14:49:04] Yep. If I’m testing from the other direction.
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[14:49:18] Typically, I’m concerned about one direction or the other at the time.
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[14:49:28] I’ve never had a need to set up a full cycle at once.
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[14:50:01] Also, if you’re chasing a bug reported by QA you can ask those guys if they could get the iWorld XML files from Retail Translation
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[14:50:13] Then use those as fixtures to be read by a RetrieveTranslationsJob
2012-12-14 09:21:20	stevenharman	[14:50:45] Good call.
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[14:50:58] Or just modify Client#download_and_extract_project to read from the file instead of request from a server
2012-12-14 09:21:20	stevenharman	[14:51:25] I'm just getting back to tracking down the odd behavior we saw while trying to submit stuff to iWorld the other day. Where only some files were making it to the server.
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[14:51:31] Yep.
2012-12-14 09:21:20	stevenharman	[14:52:03] When I submit a Lesson that is in both France and Switzerland, we expect to see 2 files written, Yes?
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[14:52:05] The other thing I find useful is dropping into the debugger at the beginning of a SendTranslationsJob and then stepping through every action 
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[14:52:21] Three, I think
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[14:52:27] Two French, one German
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[14:52:37] fr-fr, de-CH, fr-CH
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[14:53:05] Remember that fr-FR and fr-CH, while the same language, may have different localizations
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[14:55:00] Standby
2012-12-14 09:21:20	stevenharman	[14:58:33] Right.

2012-12-14 09:21:20	jonathanwallace1	[16:21:41] zdennis: also, i haven't reviewed #290 yet but Github is reporting that it won't merge cleanly at the moment
2012-12-14 09:21:20	zdennis	[16:26:12] jonathanwallace1: yah, merge away on 260! TY
2012-12-14 09:21:20	zdennis	[16:26:46] jonathanwallace1: on 290, I haven't heard back from EC yet… EC, ping pong!
2012-12-14 09:21:20	jonathanwallace1	[16:27:07] merged!
2012-12-14 09:21:20	zdennis	[16:28:13] jonathanwallace1: I think you can merge 290 if you are okay with resolving a merge conflict. There's another branch in next-release that needs to be taken out (or at least not merged into master). 
2012-12-14 09:21:20	jonathanwallace1	[16:28:21] zdennis: ah, i just read your comment on their
2012-12-14 09:21:20	jonathanwallace1	[16:28:31] s/their/there!
2012-12-14 09:21:20	zdennis	[16:29:22] it's a two line conflict though, I'd be happy to tell you which line to toss and what to keep
2012-12-14 09:21:20	zdennis	[16:29:29] or if you want to wait until I hear back from EC, that works to
2012-12-14 09:21:20	jonathanwallace1	[16:31:35] zdennis: 260 was supposed to be merged into master, correct?
2012-12-14 09:21:20	zdennis	[16:31:49] no, next-release
2012-12-14 09:21:20	jonathanwallace1	[16:31:52] uhoh
2012-12-14 09:21:20	zdennis	[16:32:05] sorry, that PR was created before next-release took on its prominence
2012-12-14 09:21:20	jonathanwallace1	[16:32:32] i shoulda caught that before merging but i didn't catch it until after
2012-12-14 09:21:20	zdennis	[16:32:43] the commit master was at before was bd245409599d2d5b25189c987fd1753b2a519b79
2012-12-14 09:21:20	jonathanwallace1	[16:33:50] i'm not sure how to back out of a github merge
2012-12-14 09:21:20	zdennis	[16:34:24] jonathanwallace1: in the past I just reset master back to the good commit using reset --hard 
2012-12-14 09:21:20	zdennis	[16:34:30] and then force push master
2012-12-14 09:21:20	jonathanwallace1	[16:34:45] what will that do to the PR?
2012-12-14 09:21:20	zdennis	[16:34:50] i don't think anything
2012-12-14 09:21:20	jonathanwallace1	[16:34:53] k
2012-12-14 09:21:20	jonathanwallace1	[16:34:57] doing that now
2012-12-14 09:21:20	zdennis	[16:34:59] since it's closed, it's kind of in a frozen stable i believe
2012-12-14 09:21:20	zdennis	[16:35:52] *state
2012-12-14 09:21:20	zdennis	[16:37:10] jonathanwallace1: do you want to do a manual merge --no-ff into next-release for that branch or would you like me to open a new PR (I'll see if I can re-open 260) ?
2012-12-14 09:21:20	zdennis	[16:37:34] jonathanwallace1: cool, my local master is now back in sync with remote master.  master looks good
2012-12-14 09:21:20	jonathanwallace1	[16:37:38] i've restored master to its appropriate state
2012-12-14 09:21:20	jonathanwallace1	[16:37:41] cool
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[16:37:57] zdennis: Is this in regards to your email?
2012-12-14 09:21:20	jonathanwallace1	[16:38:19] open a new PR to stick with the same work flow
2012-12-14 09:21:20	jonathanwallace1	[16:38:29] or #260 if you can re-open
2012-12-14 09:21:20	zdennis	[16:38:36] EC: yeah for PR 290. To merge and resolve now, or to wait and restore next-release to pristinity.
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[16:38:50] I’ll read it now.
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[16:39:56] Never mind my never mind
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[16:39:58] lol
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[16:40:23] I’m trying to process the problem
2012-12-14 09:21:20	zdennis	[16:42:21] jonathanwallace1: https://code.apple.com/RetailSoftwareEngineering/intersect/pull/292
2012-12-14 09:21:20	jonathanwallace1	[16:42:58] zdennis: merged!
2012-12-14 09:21:20	zdennis	[16:43:20] EC: let me know if any questions or if just to tell me that nothing what I wrote makes sense. 
2012-12-14 09:21:20	zdennis	[16:43:23] thx jonathanwallace1 
2012-12-14 09:21:20	zdennis	[16:44:36] jonathanwallace1: who is charles quinn?
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[16:45:19] zdennis: Replied.
2012-12-14 09:21:20	zdennis	[16:45:28] thnx EC 
2012-12-14 09:21:20	jonathanwallace1	[16:45:35] zdennis: the CEO of Highgroove/Big Nerd Ranch
2012-12-14 09:21:20	jonathanwallace1	[16:45:40] all my credentials expired :(
2012-12-14 09:21:20	zdennis	[16:46:02] leading a double life eh?
2012-12-14 09:21:20	jonathanwallace1	[16:46:05] he's got some commits here and there backfrom when we first came on the project and his credentials haven't expired
2012-12-14 09:21:20	jonathanwallace1	[16:46:14] pretty much
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[16:46:20] No, Mark just put him out on the street.
2012-12-14 09:21:20	jonathanwallace1	[16:46:50] is hard living on the streets
2012-12-14 09:21:20	jonathanwallace1	[16:47:15] :)
2012-12-14 09:21:20	zdennis	[16:47:29] jonathanwallace1: I imagine something like this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wN0xK6bgQkQ
2012-12-14 09:21:20	zdennis	[16:47:50] jonathanwallace1: for PR 290, I think we're good if you can merge and resolve that conflict locally before pushing up to next-release
2012-12-14 09:21:20	jonathanwallace1	[16:48:43] haha, that song definitely sums up the difficulties of my programmer life 'cept
2012-12-14 09:21:20	jonathanwallace1	[16:48:51] they left out the part where my fingers get cold in winter
2012-12-14 09:21:20	greggroth	[16:52:29] jonathanwallace1: http://www.amazon.com/Ra-Key-Radiant-Keyboard-Desktop-Heater/dp/B006TMKLSO
2012-12-14 09:21:20	greggroth	[16:52:42] I honestly didn't know it was a thing, but now I want one.
2012-12-14 09:21:20	jonathanwallace1	[16:56:45] nice
2012-12-14 09:21:20	zdennis	[17:01:21] jonathanwallace1: I added a comment on PR 290 about the conflict resolution in case I'm not around I don't want to hold you up if you get a chance to review it
2012-12-14 09:21:20	stevenharman	[17:09:04] EC: What is the difference b/t "Publication Status" of "Unpublished" and "Drafted"?
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[17:18:42] stevenharman: Does “Unpublished” appear only in the UI or is it also a state in a state machine somewhere?
2012-12-14 09:21:20	stevenharman	[17:18:52] UI
2012-12-14 09:21:20	stevenharman	[17:19:12] it may also be elsewhere, but I was curious about it in the UI.
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[17:19:32] I’m not sure.
2012-12-14 09:21:20	stevenharman	[17:19:34] I was trying to submit a lesson (in france and Switzerland) for translation, and only one was "sent"
2012-12-14 09:21:20	stevenharman	[17:19:41] The other said "Pending Globalization"
2012-12-14 09:21:20	stevenharman	[17:20:06] I was screwing around in the UI a lot, so maybe I got it into some weird state that I don't understand. I just started anew with a clean Lesson.
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[17:20:08] My best guess is that maybe the client is using “Unpublished” to mean the document is no longer in a published state and is past its sunset time?
2012-12-14 09:21:20	stevenharman	[17:20:24] These lessons have no sunset.
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[17:20:26] Try tossing that question to the Mac team.
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[17:20:47] I only know a “published” state server-side.
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[17:22:09] Just asked Kenny, too
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[17:22:41] According to Kennard
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[17:22:53] The client is interpreting the state machine state for the GoLive
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[17:23:04] And “approved” is mapped to “Unpublished”
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[17:23:11] (He’s going to take care of that.)
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[17:24:24] Does that help?
2012-12-14 09:21:20	stevenharman	[17:36:27] Yeah, I was mostly just confused.
2012-12-14 09:21:20	stevenharman	[17:37:34] Oh... and I found something.
2012-12-14 09:21:20	stevenharman	[17:38:10] Do you remember how we used to put the `requested_locale` and `submitted_locale` into the XML we sent to iWorld? But we don't do that any more b/c it's not actually used...
2012-12-14 09:21:20	stevenharman	[17:38:31] EC ^
2012-12-14 09:21:20	stevenharman	[17:40:25] without having those in there we could end up with the exact same content in the XML file (assuming you didn't add any localizations or whatever). Yes?
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[17:40:30] Yes, I do
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[17:40:35] Yep
2012-12-14 09:21:20	stevenharman	[17:40:46] And if the content is the same, then they'll hash the same, so they'll have the same "filename"
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[17:40:49] It was probably added for human use only :)
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[17:40:54] Ohhhhhh
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[17:40:59] I never thought about that!
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[17:41:10] Dammit
2012-12-14 09:21:20	stevenharman	[17:41:20] Yeah.
2012-12-14 09:21:20	stevenharman	[17:41:40] I'm thinking that might be why we only saw 1 file make it to iWorld when we expected 3
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[17:41:46] Yep
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[17:41:49] That makes complete sense
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[17:41:57] And is so obvious now
2012-12-14 09:21:20	stevenharman	[17:42:00] I'm thinking I'll add a NEW key in each doc, but with a very obvious name.
2012-12-14 09:21:20	stevenharman	[17:42:22] So we don't delete it again :)
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[17:42:29] I wouldn’t mind the submitted locale being re-added to the XML, too.
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[17:42:48] When you’re looking through the files on Retail Translation’s side it’s the only way to identify what RetailMe locale you’re working with
2012-12-14 09:21:20	stevenharman	[17:42:51] Sure, but maybe with "better" names so we know why the heck they are there.
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[17:42:55] Yep
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[17:43:14] I agree do the keying/file naming in a way that is more evident, though
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[17:43:26] Good find
2012-12-14 09:21:20	stevenharman	[17:47:10] Thanks.
2012-12-14 09:21:20	zdennis	[11:40:13] My Mac is experiencing random reboots this morning. :(
2012-12-14 09:21:20	zdennis	[11:40:20] A sad thursday.
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[15:47:52] Are most here using Mac OS X Mail as their email client?
2012-12-14 09:21:20	zdennis|afk	[15:58:00] EC: I use Mail.app for Appl and GMail web for non-Apple. Tried Sparrow for a while, but I kind of hated it.
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[16:05:05] You should get an S/MIME certificate so we can exchange encrypted mail.
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[16:05:29] Mac OS X Mail makes it painless to use S/MIME once you have the certificate installed.
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[16:06:22] I just sent a document to Greggory that doesn’t contain any top-secret Apple plans but that could be damaging to Apple if intercepted.
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[16:06:45] Since we’re using your non-Apple accounts that’s traveling over the public network.
2012-12-14 09:21:20	zdennis	[16:07:37] okay sounds good
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[16:08:12] Done that before?
2012-12-14 09:21:20	zdennis	[16:08:32] back when I used Thunderbird :)
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[16:09:32] Great
2012-12-14 09:21:20	greggroth	[16:14:03] I use sparrow
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[16:31:41] What is S/MIME support like?
2012-12-14 09:21:20	greggroth	[16:40:40] I believe nonexistent
2012-12-14 09:21:20	greggroth	[16:40:52] I can use mail.app for my apple mail though if its important
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[16:42:57] No, use what you like.
2012-12-14 09:21:20	greggroth	[16:43:26] k
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[16:43:30] If the risk is high enough and I need to ensure its protection I will either deliver to your apple.com address or send it to you using Attaché
2012-12-14 09:21:20	greggroth	[16:43:49] sounds good.
2012-12-14 09:21:20	greggroth	[16:44:04] I'm heading home for the day.  See y'all tomorrow!
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[16:44:06] S/MIME is a nice-to-have that mitigates the risk a little more
2012-12-14 09:21:20	EC	[16:44:15] Night!
2012-12-14 09:21:20	zdennis	[17:27:58] There is a small PR ready for review regarding upgrading capybara if any one gets a chance: https://code.apple.com/RetailSoftwareEngineering/intersect/pull/293
2012-12-14 09:21:20	zdennis	[17:28:50] Going to the CollectiveIdea open house tonight. See you all tomorrow!
