2013-05-22 14:56:10	jonathanwallace	greggroth was saying that its the responsibility of QA to ensure that the SHA / branch we mention once marking something as "Ready for QA" has been deployed before QA'ing the item

2013-05-29 14:37:44	greggroth	the client guys and I were chatting and it's my understanding that a task doesn't have a sunset date.
2013-05-29 14:38:19	greggroth	A task is visible once it's within 30 days on it's due date and is hidden once it has been marked completed.
2013-05-29 14:38:35	greggroth	Does that sounds familiar/reasonable?
2013-05-29 15:02:39	EC	yes
2013-05-29 15:02:51	EC	Tasks have UI for a sunset time but tasks do not sunset
2013-05-29 15:03:05	EC	You can call it either a bug or a feature request and be right
2013-05-29 15:06:40	greggroth	Is the solution to disable the date select for sunset date?
2013-05-29 15:10:46	greggroth	I'm changing locations.  I'll be back on in ~20 min

2013-06-10 15:55:19	jonathanwallace	this would allow QA to run through and discover other possible bugs that were occluded by the inability to save lessons

2013-06-10 16:25:17	@EC	I’ll start exploring some ideas right now.
2013-06-10 16:26:11	@EC	If I start from 386170 should the latest RetailMe Mac (training) work with it?
2013-06-10 16:26:58	jtamboli	I have the code for using retailme_id in a branch right now. I can test it, or it's up as training_features/jay/step-ordering-with-retailme-id if you want to try.

2013-06-13 12:24:41	@EC	jonathanwallace, greggroth: With 618 I think we’re in good enough shape to integrate and let QA test further
2013-06-13 12:24:56	@EC	Would still like to refactor LessonsController but it’s no longer prohibitive
2013-06-13 12:37:40	greggroth	EC  I found a problem with the way translations were being merged, but have resolved it (updated the PR) and jonathanwallace is running the test suite now
2013-06-13 12:38:32	greggroth	jonathanwallace is running it because it accumulates memory until it grinds to a halt and I have to kill it.  I'm working out why it's a problem for me and no one else.
2013-06-13 12:39:47	@EC	Oh fun
2013-06-13 12:40:34	greggroth	I take it you haven't had problems with the test suite, right?
2013-06-13 12:43:12	@EC	No but I have tons of RAM and I also haven’t run it on the training branch recently
2013-06-13 12:43:16	@EC	Just master and next-release
2013-06-13 12:43:24	@EC	So I’m not sure that tells us anything
2013-06-13 12:43:41	@EC	Start recently?
2013-06-13 12:44:28	greggroth	I think it was about a week or so ago.  Hard to say exactly, though.

2013-06-13 12:49:21	greggroth	jonathanwallace: do you know why we're using andy's fork of resque?
2013-06-13 12:50:13	jonathanwallace	it used to be because resque was ignored and we needed to fix something
2013-06-13 12:50:18	jonathanwallace	but that was a looong time ago
2013-06-13 12:51:00	jonathanwallace	he may remember
2013-06-13 12:51:35	greggroth	I've found a feature (lesson_publication.feature#220) that wont run (just hangs).  It's testing lesson sunsetting by enqueuing resque jobs.
2013-06-13 12:51:59	greggroth	It's made me curious if we should try upgrading resque.
2013-06-13 12:52:21	greggroth	because, you know, we don't already have enough failures to deal with :trollface:
2013-06-13 12:52:27	jonathanwallace	:)
2013-06-13 12:52:49	jonathanwallace	we probably should at some point
2013-06-13 12:52:50	greggroth	I might try it just to see if it doesn't by chance resolve my issues.
2013-06-13 13:14:12	@EC	greggroth: Are you running OS X?
2013-06-13 13:15:56	@EC	If so, while the tests are hung try using opensnoop to peer in on the files cucumber is accessing
2013-06-13 13:16:04	@EC	Sometimes give a clue as to what’s happening
2013-06-13 13:16:19	@EC	sudo opensnoop -p <PID of Cucumber process>
2013-06-13 13:16:56	@EC	Also, do you experience the same problem with the test suite when running against master?
2013-06-13 13:22:33	greggroth	oddly enough it's running now without issue.  If it hangs again I'll try opensnoop.  I haven't tried the tests on master in a long time.
2013-06-13 13:31:07	jonathanwallace	the test suite is hanging for me
2013-06-13 13:32:44	greggroth	I've cursed everyone.
2013-06-13 13:56:30	greggroth	jtamboli: Does the client expect image id's to be consistent?
2013-06-13 14:00:57	jtamboli	greggroth: I think the Mac expects them to be consistent while the client is running, yes. If they were to change monthly or something, while no one was using them, that wouldn't be a problem.

2013-06-18 18:06:54	@EC	I agree on not guessing
2013-06-18 18:07:03	@EC	Often ends up being a terrible waste of time
2013-06-18 18:21:41	stevenharman	Turned out NOT to be the same Lesson.
2013-06-18 18:21:50	stevenharman	I commented on the card, and am digging more now.
2013-06-18 18:25:50	greggroth	stevenharman: :-|  sorry if my guesswork led you down the wrong path.
2013-06-18 18:26:54	greggroth	stevenharman: also, did you figure out how to make yourself a pantheon user?  I'm having problems checking out lessons on qa1 and harmann suggested I try adding myself to that group.
2013-06-18 18:27:20	stevenharman	Unsure.
2013-06-18 18:27:27	stevenharman	But I think we are all pantheon users...?
2013-06-18 18:30:27	greggroth	stevenharman: If you have a minute, can you try checking out a lesson on qa1?  When I try it, there's a PUT request to check out the lesson, but at the next GET request to retrieve the lesson it shows it as not checked out.
2013-06-18 18:31:02	greggroth	and I can't ssh into qa1 to check the logs
2013-06-18 18:36:54	stevenharman	I was able to checkout a lesson fine.
2013-06-18 18:37:07	stevenharman	Perhaps I'm in Pantheon but you're not?
2013-06-18 18:37:22	harmann	see if you have user_group 1113 on your user
2013-06-18 18:37:45	harmann	You actually just need to be a training admin, but I don't know that group id
2013-06-18 18:38:54	stevenharman	I don't see 1113 in the logs.
2013-06-18 18:39:07	harmann	EC: can you correct me if I'm wrong?  You have to be an admin to checkout for a specific module?

2013-06-18 19:10:14	@EC	Two things then:
2013-06-18 19:10:33	@EC	1) You are never guaranteed the Pantheon group will be a certain ID
2013-06-18 19:10:47	@EC	The best way to access it is through UserGroup.pantheon
2013-06-18 19:11:13	@EC	2) To *check out* a lesson it must not be checked out by another user
2013-06-18 19:11:41	@EC	Pantheon membership will bestow upon you the ability to force-check-in a document
2013-06-18 19:11:49	@EC	But until it is checked in you will not be able to check it out
2013-06-18 19:11:54	@EC	(Through Mac, anyway.)

2013-06-18 20:26:33	harmann	gregg, how about trying to create a new lesson?
2013-06-18 20:29:04	@EC	Or a new message
2013-06-18 20:29:23	@EC	Let’s go back to basics, actually
2013-06-18 20:29:34	@EC	Can you send me a screen recording of the issue?
2013-06-18 20:30:41	greggroth	If I create the lesson I can edit/checkin/checkout like normal.  I'll make a recording of the issue.
2013-06-18 20:31:34	@EC	Ah okay
2013-06-18 20:31:44	@EC	So it only happens on a specific lesson?
2013-06-18 20:35:19	greggroth	It seems to happen with any lesson I don't own.
2013-06-18 20:35:26	greggroth	rather I didn't author
2013-06-18 20:35:55	greggroth	I've tried with a handful of lessons and none will check out

2013-06-18 21:23:09	harmann	and you did a recursive submodule update right?

2013-06-18 21:29:15	harmann	ok, eric and jay are looking at it too.  There is definitely something weird with that build though cause your lesson list shouldn't have even shown up until the logs had finished printing.
2013-06-18 21:29:39	eblair	Well, maybe not the logs, but the internal processing
2013-06-18 21:29:46	eblair	Logging's buffered, after all
2013-06-18 21:30:23	harmann	yeah, though I tried it on mine sand had a blank list until the logs stopped
2013-06-18 21:30:33	eblair	But we don't display the editing interface until the GET request has been processed internally - that's where we get the contents for the lesson. Without that, you'd get blank content
2013-06-18 21:37:51	harmann	Sorry we couldn't figure it out.  I'll keep looking at it.  lemme know if you find anything tomorrow

2013-06-19 13:34:43	greggroth	When I test it with my local dev server (running from the same commit as QA1), it makes a GET request for the lesson and a PUT request to check it out and that's it.

2013-06-19 13:49:20	jtamboli	Could you maybe try a build from Jenkins to make sure it's not something related to the way your machines are building the app?
2013-06-19 13:49:25	jtamboli	I think you can download them from http://rmetouchbld2.apple.com:8080/view/Training%20with%20Mongoid/job/RetailMe-Mac-Training-Release/
2013-06-19 13:50:03	greggroth	k
2013-06-19 13:51:53	greggroth	RetailMe-Release-2.2.12a-404-g7be4cf3.dmg
2013-06-19 13:51:57	greggroth	same bug
2013-06-19 13:52:58	harmann	Remind me - did we try pointing at a different server yesterday as well just to see?
2013-06-19 13:53:41	jtamboli	And that same build works for me. How odd.
2013-06-19 13:53:51	harmann	yeah, me too
2013-06-19 13:55:14	greggroth	I only tried QA1 and my local server.
2013-06-19 13:55:15	greggroth	intersect-qa-nexta.apple.com
2013-06-19 13:55:28	greggroth	and intersect-qa-nextb.apple.com are both running the same commit
2013-06-19 13:55:33	greggroth	I can try those.
2013-06-19 13:55:34	harmann	greggroth.  hold option when you launch and make sure your server is https not http?
2013-06-19 13:56:35	greggroth	ARHAHRAHHRHAHARHAHARHARHARHA   that was it.
2013-06-19 13:56:44	greggroth	what an odd way to fail.
2013-06-19 13:56:52	greggroth	I would have thought it wouldn't get any data without https
2013-06-19 13:57:01	harmann	I think it's something with the redirecting from the non secure servers
2013-06-19 13:57:10	harmann	yeah, I dunno
2013-06-19 13:57:23	harmann	phew :)
2013-06-19 13:58:09	greggroth	that's just a really weird way to fail.
2013-06-19 13:58:22	jtamboli	I agree; that's odd.
2013-06-19 13:58:40	greggroth	anyways -- back to testing real bugs!  I'm really sorry for taking up y'alls time with something that ended up being human error.
2013-06-19 13:59:28	harmann	no worries.  we're also gonna see if we have some time to make sure we catch this and find out why it's failing like that.  Maybe EC has some insight as well.

2013-06-19 14:31:43	greggroth	thanks!
2013-06-19 14:56:48	greggroth	How does converting a lesson affect it's or it's contents translations?  The server should merge translations by the locale, but 2069 occurs because of a validation error due to multiple translations for the same locale.  There's a huge request body, so I'm still trying to understand it to make sure there aren't multiple translations being sent.
2013-06-19 15:08:41	@EC	harmann: No insight. Securing the connection should have no effect.
2013-06-19 15:09:05	@EC	In fact, greggroth is correct that, in general, using an insecure connection would net you no data.
2013-06-19 15:20:42	@EC	Also, greggroth, if you want to connect directly to a development environment using a secure connection (instead of proxying through -dev) I can give you our CA cert. to install
2013-06-19 15:21:05	@EC	Then you can eliminate proxying as a cause

2013-06-19 17:20:39	stevenharman	I guess. I want to know what the translations for a particular Training::Lesson look like.
2013-06-19 17:20:49	stevenharman	specifically, their "published" attributes.
2013-06-19 17:34:13	@EC	I think you could get that by making a GET through the API, too

2013-06-20 13:43:54	stevenharman	I need to see if the published Lessons in question have all of their Translations' #published attribute set to true/false.
2013-06-20 13:44:06	stevenharman	Normally I'd just SSH into the QA1 box, but I don't have SSH access.
2013-06-20 13:44:41	stevenharman	Will you be able to run some commands to tell me what those values are, or can I just get SSH access to do it myself?

2013-06-20 13:45:11	druibarra	sure i can run commands for you
2013-06-20 13:51:16	stevenharman	I'm trying to reproduce it again, letting the system run the jobs and such, so I'll know more in about 30 min.
2013-06-20 13:51:59	stevenharman	EC: re: https://greenhopper.apple.com/browse/RMETR-2194... I've been kicking off the lesson publication and sunset jobs manually (via the Resque scheduler UI) and everything seems to work fine.
2013-06-20 13:52:33	stevenharman	However, the QA testers are reporting that the Lessons are not being "unpublished" on the touch side. The Mac, however, does report them as unpublished.
2013-06-20 13:53:05	druibarra	do you have the id# of the lesson?
2013-06-20 13:53:09	stevenharman	I'm wondering if maybe a job isn't running, or if somehow the creator-side docs are being "unpublished" before the sunset job gets a chance to run.
2013-06-20 13:54:44	stevenharman	druibarra: Training::Lesson.find(1502)
2013-06-20 13:55:08	stevenharman	Then I want to see the lesson's translations.
2013-06-20 13:56:00	@EC	You have to be careful with the publication statuses indicated in Mac
2013-06-20 13:56:29	@EC	Since it’s using the server’s state machine states to determine status what you’re seeing is the status of the *staged* document
2013-06-20 13:57:00	stevenharman	Yeah, that's fine.
2013-06-20 13:57:08	druibarra	the publish/unpublish jobs are running on QA1
2013-06-20 13:57:08	@EC	For example, “Unpublished” could mean the current staged/Creator representation has been modified and that representation has not been published
2013-06-20 13:57:21	@EC	But it doesn’t mean there are no published representations out there
2013-06-20 13:58:03	stevenharman	So what I'm saying is the creator side doc considers itself to be "unpublished", but the published docuement (intersect-side, or whatever you want to call it) is still published.
2013-06-20 14:00:00	stevenharman	I just created a new lesson (Titled "Lesson for Unpublishing"). The Mac reported it was "Unpublished."
2013-06-20 14:00:12	@EC	Which is accurate
2013-06-20 14:00:15	stevenharman	After about 5 minutes, the Mac app reports it has been "Published."
2013-06-20 14:00:17	@EC	Since it has never been published
2013-06-20 14:00:19	stevenharman	I verified that on the Touch.
2013-06-20 14:00:21	@EC	“Accurate”
2013-06-20 14:00:27	@EC	k
2013-06-20 14:00:55	stevenharman	I just now (1 min ago) opned it in the Mac app and set a Sunset date of June 18th, 2013 (2 days ago). Ans saved the document.
2013-06-20 14:01:06	stevenharman	The Mac app still reports it as "Published."
2013-06-20 14:01:25	stevenharman	In 30 minutes I'd expect to be able to refresh it in the mac and see "Unpublished."
2013-06-20 14:01:38	@EC	That’s a reasonable expectation :)
2013-06-20 14:01:41	stevenharman	And after signing out and back into the Touch app, I'd not be able to find it.
2013-06-20 14:02:13	@EC	But what you’re actually seeing is Mac displays “Unpublished” and you can still access the lesson on Touch, right?
2013-06-20 14:02:19	stevenharman	Correct.
2013-06-20 14:02:35	@EC	But you cannot reproduce the issue locally?
2013-06-20 14:02:42	stevenharman	In fact, I just did a Cmd-R (to refresh the Mac app) and it now reports "Unpublished."
2013-06-20 14:03:05	stevenharman	I'm checking Touch now... hold on....
2013-06-20 14:03:37	stevenharman	That lesson is now not visible in Touch.
2013-06-20 14:03:39	stevenharman	WTF?
2013-06-20 14:03:52	stevenharman	QA is reporting this is busted. I don't understand...
2013-06-20 14:05:20	@EC	Maybe we don’t have enough info.
2013-06-20 14:05:24	@EC	Could be missing something
2013-06-20 14:05:30	stevenharman	Maybe.
2013-06-20 14:06:25	@EC	We could also give you impersonation capability on that server and you could try to reproduce the issue as Ally
2013-06-20 14:06:30	@EC	Could be user-specific
2013-06-20 14:06:33	@EC	Like a certain locale pair
2013-06-20 14:06:50	@EC	Or privileges may be affecting the experience between you and her
2013-06-20 14:06:54	stevenharman	This works locally (where I have to enqueu the publish and sunset jobs via irb), and on the server when I queue the jobs via the Resque scheduler UI. And now I've just verified it on the server by letting the jobs run as scheduled.
2013-06-20 14:06:58	stevenharman	Could be...
2013-06-20 14:07:10	stevenharman	Lets try that...
2013-06-20 14:07:19	stevenharman	Impersonation, I mean. What do we need to do?
2013-06-20 14:07:34	@EC	First step is to coordinate this with Ally
2013-06-20 14:07:42	@EC	So she is aware you’ll be using her account
2013-06-20 14:08:10	stevenharman	Apparently Richard Sams is seeing the same thing.
2013-06-20 14:08:28	stevenharman	He was able to reproduce it last night.
2013-06-20 14:09:24	@EC	I would leave a comment in the Jira issue asking Ally if it is okay if you sign in as her on -qa*
2013-06-20 14:10:00	@EC	Explain that you have been unsuccessful in reproducing the issue and would like to remove as many variables as possible. One of those is that you’ve been testing with a different account.

2013-07-09 09:19:54	gaffneyc	Yeah
2013-07-09 09:20:01	gaffneyc	Can do in two steps as well
2013-07-09 09:20:34	gaffneyc	Okay, going to drop the entire database. Then do another mongorestore
2013-07-09 09:20:39	@EC	k
2013-07-09 09:20:41	@EC	sorry
2013-07-09 09:21:18	@EC	Resque is running
2013-07-09 09:21:35	@EC	Ughh
2013-07-09 09:21:46	@EC	Consistency
2013-07-09 09:22:12	@EC	Has Mongo gone away?
2013-07-09 09:22:13	stevenharman	EC: greggroth just pointed this out
2013-07-09 09:22:14	stevenharman	https://code.apple.com/RetailSoftwareEngineering/intersect/blob/c406bf38a0d26e5edac741fb3485626fad53b2dc/lib/creator/has_retailme_id.rb#L6
2013-07-09 09:22:28	@EC	Actually, it really doesn’t matter either way
2013-07-09 09:22:43	@EC	I was going to suggest renaming the newer collection but that may not be consistent
2013-07-09 09:22:51	@EC	However, MySQL has started to diverge from Mongo as well
2013-07-09 09:23:22	gaffneyc	Running restore
2013-07-09 09:23:41	gaffneyc	EC: Mongo collection will have
2013-07-09 09:24:25	gaffneyc	We can kill resque and start mysql over again if we need to
2013-07-09 09:24:34	@EC	let’s kill Resque for sure
2013-07-09 09:25:02	gaffneyc	Stopping resque
2013-07-09 09:25:37	@EC	We probably need to do MySQL
2013-07-09 09:25:58	@EC	If, for example, one of those jobs created a new access ruleset and stored its ID on a MySQL record
2013-07-09 09:26:05	@EC	The access ruleset will not be found later
2013-07-09 09:26:06	@EC	Fuck
2013-07-09 09:26:21	gaffneyc	Ok
2013-07-09 09:26:22	@EC	When you do a MySQL restore do you use copy back or move back?
2013-07-09 09:26:25	gaffneyc	I'll get the process started
2013-07-09 09:26:37	gaffneyc	Copy
2013-07-09 09:26:46	gaffneyc	Have to copy it from the NFS
2013-07-09 09:26:50	@EC	ohhh
2013-07-09 09:26:55	@EC	That’s right
2013-07-09 09:26:57	@EC	Dammit
2013-07-09 09:27:09	gaffneyc	No worries, getting it started
2013-07-09 09:28:01	gaffneyc	Better to be consistent than not sure
2013-07-09 09:36:55	gaffneyc	Building indexes in mongo
2013-07-09 09:36:55	gaffneyc	mysql 20%
2013-07-09 09:37:14	stevenharman	EC: The code I just linked would mean that retailme_id is a string, so that comparison when finding the head_step would work.
2013-07-09 09:37:42	stevenharman	Which makes me even more suspicious of your first thougth - the `joins(:current_translations)` thing.
2013-07-09 09:39:12	gaffneyc	mongo restored without production_log
2013-07-09 09:43:25	gaffneyc	Restoring production_log would have left it an unbounded collection
2013-07-09 09:43:36	gaffneyc	Created 38GB capped collection for production_log
2013-07-09 09:43:43	gaffneyc	db.createCollection("production_log", { capped: true, size: 40802189312 })

2013-07-09 09:45:36	@EC	Then pull up a Creator::Lesson and call…I think ordered_steps?

2013-07-09 09:53:14	@EC	I got false
2013-07-09 09:53:30	stevenharman	Hmm...
2013-07-09 09:53:30	@EC	Until I added #to_s on retailme_id
2013-07-09 09:54:01	@EC	step.retailme_id.class returned Moped::BSON::Id (or something close)
2013-07-09 09:54:50	stevenharman	I did a rake db:reset and just fired up console.
2013-07-09 09:55:42	gaffneyc	mysql 83%
2013-07-09 09:55:45	greggroth	oh I bet that's because `retailme_id` returns the `id` if the retailme_if hasn't been set
2013-07-09 09:55:57	@EC	lol of course
2013-07-09 09:56:01	@EC	so obvious now
2013-07-09 09:56:17	greggroth	It'd prob be best to put a `to_s` in the `retailme_id` method to ensure it *always* returns a string
2013-07-09 09:56:32	greggroth	sorry -- that was my fault.  I overlooked the different types
2013-07-09 09:56:37	@EC	So it may happen with imported lessons that have no #retailme_id
2013-07-09 09:56:45	greggroth	right
2013-07-09 09:57:21	greggroth	you were right that the `retailme_id`/`id` coupling would cause headaches.
2013-07-09 09:58:07	stevenharman	EC: So you were working with imported Lessons?
2013-07-09 09:58:14	stevenharman	Mine was just created anew via console.
2013-07-09 09:58:26	@EC	yes
2013-07-09 09:58:47	@EC	I was tracing lesson 251 through its migration
2013-07-09 09:58:56	greggroth	stevenharman: If you try it with a new lesson that doesn't have `retailme_id` set you should see the behavior EC's talking about
2013-07-09 09:59:32	greggroth	because this:
2013-07-09 09:59:33	greggroth	https://code.apple.com/RetailSoftwareEngineering/intersect/blob/training/lib/creator/has_retailme_id.rb#L12
2013-07-09 09:59:38	greggroth	doesn't cast the `id` to a string
2013-07-09 09:59:56	stevenharman	When does retailme_id get set for a Lesson?
2013-07-09 10:00:00	stevenharman	It doesn't, right?
2013-07-09 10:00:05	stevenharman	So it always falls through.
2013-07-09 10:00:25	greggroth	for steps, the client *should* set it, but existing steps don't have it set
2013-07-09 10:00:38	greggroth	so it'll be `nil` and the method will return the BSON `id`
2013-07-09 10:01:05	greggroth	Lessons don't include that module and don't have `retailme_id`
2013-07-09 10:01:15	stevenharman	Oh yeah, Steps, not Lesson.
2013-07-09 10:01:46	greggroth	the existing content doesn't have `retailme_id` set so will always be `id` until they're updated by the client
2013-07-09 10:02:14	stevenharman	EC: Which might explain what dru was seeing.
2013-07-09 10:02:15	gaffneyc	Copy done. Finishing up
2013-07-09 10:02:25	stevenharman	Opening in the Mac app and re-publishing.
2013-07-09 10:02:40	greggroth	I have to get back to the iOS class, but ping me in campfire (so I get hte notification) if you need me
2013-07-09 10:02:44	greggroth	stevenharman: ^
2013-07-09 10:02:47	stevenharman	OK
2013-07-09 10:02:52	gaffneyc	EC: mysql is online
2013-07-09 10:02:55	gaffneyc	And so is mongo
2013-07-09 10:03:15	@EC	I don’t think it’s wise for me to log onto the console of either
2013-07-09 10:03:27	@EC	Would you mind logging in and making sure the collections and tables look right?

2013-07-09 10:17:53	koldrid	ok

2013-07-09 10:18:23	@EC	cgaffney: Should we open the gates?
2013-07-09 10:18:54	koldrid	only alarm I am seeing is DB3 mysql not running

2013-07-09 10:19:17	@EC	Will probably happen throughout today

2013-07-09 10:20:53	@EC	As comfortable as I’m going to be
